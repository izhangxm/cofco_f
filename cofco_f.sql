The key differences from most existing video hashing methods lie in 1) UDVH is an unsupervised hashing method that generates hash codes by cooperatively utilizing feature clustering and a specifically-designed binarization with the original neighborhood structure preserved in the binary space; 2) a specific rotation is developed and applied onto video features such that the variance of each dimension can be balanced, thus facilitating the subsequent quantization step. Extensive experiments performed on three popular video datasets show that UDVH is overwhelmingly better than the state-of-the-arts in terms of various evaluation metrics, which makes it practical in real-world applications.', '', '', 'United States', '10.1109/TIP.2018.2882155', NULL, '', '', '', '1', '', NULL, '');

The participants had to search for target words among parafoveally presented semantic, orthographic or target-unrelated distractor words while their electroencephalogram was recorded.

Cipher Puzzle is a filtering method that has low storage overhead along with high security, especially against denial of service (DoS) attacks. However, its number of hash iterations cannot be bounded, which causes sender-side delay. This paper proposes a Dynamic Cipher Puzzle (DCP), which uses a threshold function to limit the number of hash iterations. Hence, time at the sender-side can be used more efficiently. Besides, its dynamic puzzle-strength increases the obscurity of the transmitted packet. Simulation and experimental results were analyzed with Arduino 2560. The theoretical results show that the quadratic function outperformed the compared methods. The scheme decreased sender-side delay by 94.6% with a guarantee of zero solution probability in 1.728 × 10 - 13 .

We examined the potential for habitat and predators to control densities and distributions of bivalves in a field caging experiment (Mya only) and laboratory mesocosm experiments (both species). In the field, clams exposed to predators experienced 76.3% greater mortality as compared to caged individuals, and blue crabs were likely responsible for most of the mortality of juvenile Mya. In mesocosm experiments, Mya had lower survival in sand and seagrass than in shell hash or oyster shell habitats. However, crabs often missed one or more prey items in seagrass, shell, and oyster shell habitats. Predator search times and encounter rates declined when prey were at low densities, likely due to the added cost of inefficient foraging; however, this effect was more pronounced for Mya than for Mercenaria. Mercenaria had higher survival than Mya in mesocosm experiments, likely because predators feeding on Mercenaria spent less time foraging than those feeding on Mya. Mya may retain a low-density refuge from predation even with the loss of structurally complex habitats, though a loss of habitat refuge may result in clam densities that are not sustainable.

Therefore, batch signature is suitable for data integration authentication in IoT. An outstanding advantage of batch signature is that a signer is able to sign as many messages as possible at one time without worrying about the size of signed messages. To reduce complexity yielded by multiple message signing, a binary tree is usually leveraged in the construction of batch signature. However, this structure requires a batch residue, making the size of a batch signature (for a group of messages) even longer than the sum of single signatures. In this paper, we make use of the intersection method from lattice to propose a novel generic method for batch signature.

Toward this end, we propose a novel end-to-end ranking-based hashing framework, in this paper, termed as deep semantic-preserving ordinal hashing (DSPOH), to learn hash functions with deep neural networks by exploring the ranking structure of feature dimensions. In DSPOH, the ordinal representation, which encodes the relative rank ordering of feature dimensions, is explored to generate hash codes. Such ordinal embedding benefits from the numeric stability of rank correlation measures. To make the hash codes discriminative, the ordinal representation is expected to well predict the class labels so that the ranking-based hash function learning is optimally compatible with the label predicting. Meanwhile, the intermodality similarity is preserved to guarantee that the hash codes of different modalities are consistent. Importantly, DSPOH can be effectively integrated with different types of network architectures, which demonstrates the flexibility and scalability of our proposed hashing framework.

In this study, we propose a high-performance short sequence classification algorithm (HSC) for next generation sequencing (NGS) data based on efficient hash function and text similarity. First, HSC converts all reads into k-mers, then it forms a unique k-mer set by merging the duplicated and reverse complementary elements. Second, all unique k-mers are stored in a hash table, where the k-mer string is stored in the key field, and the ID of the reads containing the k-mer are stored in the value field. Third, each hash unit is transformed into a short text consisting of reads. Fourth, texts that satisfy the similarity threshold are combined into a long text, the merge operation is executed iteratively until there is no text that satisfies the merge condition. Finally, the long text is transformed into a cluster consisting of reads. We tested HSC using five real datasets. The experimental results showed that HSC cluster 100 million short reads within 2 hours, and it has excellent performance in reducing memory consumption. Compared to existing methods, HSC is much faster than other tools, it can easily handle tens of millions of sequences.

To overcome this difficulty, in this paper, we propose a novel scalable supervised asymmetric hashing (SSAH) method, which can skillfully approximate the full-pairwise similarity matrix based on maximum asymmetric inner product of two different non-binary embeddings. In particular, to comprehensively explore the semantic information of data, the supervised label information and the refined latent feature embedding are simultaneously considered to construct the high-quality hashing function and boost the discriminant of the learned binary codes. Specifically, SSAH learns two distinctive hashing functions in conjunction of minimizing the regression loss on the semantic label alignment and the encoding loss on the refined latent features. More importantly, instead of using only part of similarity correlations of data, the full-pairwise similarity matrix is directly utilized to avoid information loss and performance degeneration, and its cumbersome computation complexity on n×n matrix can be dexterously manipulated during the optimization phase. Furthermore, an efficient alternating optimization scheme with guaranteed convergence is designed to address the resulting discrete optimization problem.

One year later, they repeated the linear measurement task. Students with higher initial inhibitory control were more likely to adopt a more mature strategy over time. Moreover, inhibitory control was a significant predictor of strategy improvement over and above other cognitive measures, including visuospatial working memory and arithmetic calculation skill.

The popular methods include manifold-based hashing methods, which aim to learn the binary codes by embedding the original high-dimensional data into low-dimensional intrinsic subspace. However, most of these methods tend to relax the discrete constraint to compute the final binary codes in an easier way. Therefore, the information loss will increase. In this paper, we propose a novel jointly sparse regression model to minimize the locality information loss and obtain jointly sparse hashing method. The proposed model integrates locality, joint sparsity and rotation operation together with a seamless formulation. Thus, the drawback in previous methods using two separated and independent stages such as PCA-ITQ and the similar methods can be addressed. Moreover, since we introduce the joint sparsity, the feature extraction and jointly sparse feature selection can also be realized in a single projection operation, which has the potentials to select more discriminant features. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved, and the essences of the iterative procedures are also revealed.

The method first performs a fixed sampling of k-mers on the query sequence, and add these selected k-mers to a Bloom filter. Then all the k-mers of the reference sequence are tested by the Bloom filter. If a k-mer passes the test, it is inserted into a hash table for indexing.

In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to exploit the semantic similarity of the training data and design an efficient generative adversarial framework to learn binary hash codes in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, our model consists of three different neural networks: an encoder network to learn hash codes from images, a generative network to generate images from hash codes, and a discriminative network to distinguish between pairs of hash codes and images. By adversarially training these networks, we successfully learn mutually coherent encoder and generative networks and learn efficient hash codes from the encoder network. We also propose a novel strategy, which utilizes both feature and neighbor similarities, to construct a semantic similarity matrix, then use this matrix to guide the hash code learning process. Integrating the supervision of this semantic similarity matrix into the adversarial learning framework can efficiently preserve the semantic information of training data in Hamming space.

Our system is based on the observation that interactive frame rates are sufficient for capturing and reconstruction, and real-time performance is only required on the client site to achieve lag-free view updates when rendering the 3D model. Starting from this insight, we extend previous voxel block hashing frameworks by introducing a novel thread-safe GPU hash map data structure that is robust under massively concurrent retrieval, insertion and removal of entries on a thread level. We further propose a novel transmission scheme for volume data that is specifically targeted to Marching Cubes geometry reconstruction and enables a 90% reduction in bandwidth between server and exploration clients. The resulting system poses very moderate requirements on network bandwidth, latency and client-side computation, which enables it to rely entirely on consumer-grade hardware, including mobile devices.

Currently, most of the existing deep hashing methods construct pairwise or triplet-wise constraint to obtain similar binary codes between similar data pair or relative similar binary codes within a triplet. However, some critical local structures of the data are lack of exploiting, thus the effectiveness of hash learning is not fully shown.

To evaluate the effect of a solid meal on the gastrointestinal behavior of diclofenac, five healthy volunteers were recruited into a clinical study. Twenty minutes prior to diclofenac ingestion (Cataflam, 50 mg of potassium diclofenac), the volunteers were asked to eat a solid meal with the following composition corresponding to the FDA standard meal: 2 eggs, 2 bacon strips, 2 toasts, 4 ounces of hash brown potatoes, and 8 ounces of milk.

In vivo observations were complemented with in vitro research to obtain a mechanistic understanding of diclofenac\'s intraluminal behavior. Ingestion of the solid meal resulted in intraluminal pH-profiles similar to earlier studies with a liquid meal. However, intraluminal drug disposition differed. In the stomach, a substantial fraction of diclofenac appeared dissolved, despite an unfavorable acidic pH. Successive in vitro tests suggested that the dissolution of diclofenac is higher in the complex gastric medium resulting from FDA standard meal ingestion compared to liquid meal ingestion. Despite the favorable pH and in contrast to a previous study with a liquid meal, significant amounts of non-dissolved diclofenac were observed in the intestine. Further in vitro tests revealed adsorption of dissolved diclofenac molecules to bacon fragments present in the FDA standard meal. This adsorption negatively affected the permeation of diclofenac across a physical barrier, suggesting that in vivo absorption is affected as well.

Meanwhile, we unify the projections of text and image to the Hamming space into a common reconstructive embedding through rigid mathematical reformulation, which not only reduces the optimization complexity significantly but also facilitates the inter-modal similarity preservation among different modalities.

Based on this representation, a 3D pharmacophore ligand-based modeling approach to search for pharmacophores which preferably match active compounds and do not match inactive ones was developed. The approach searches for 3D pharmacophore models starting from 2D structures of available active and inactive compounds.

To this end, a unified hashing framework is formulated to simultaneously preserve visual similarities of images and perform semantic transfer from contextual modalities.

Recently, supervised multimodal hashing, which tries to preserve the semantic information obtained from the labels of training data, has received considerable attention for its higher search accuracy compared with unsupervised multimodal hashing. Although these algorithms are promising, they are mainly designed to preserve pairwise similarities. They do not enable the hash codes to preserve the discriminative information reflected by labels and, hence, the retrieval accuracies of these methods are affected. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a simple yet effective supervised multimodal hashing method, called label consistent matrix factorization hashing (LCMFH), which focuses on directly utilizing semantic labels to guide the hashing learning procedure. Considering that relevant data from different modalities have semantic correlations, LCMFH transforms heterogeneous data into latent semantic spaces in which multimodal data from the same category share the same representation. Therefore, hash codes quantified by the obtained representations are consistent with the semantic labels of the original data and, thus, can have more discriminative power for cross-modal similarity search tasks.

The key difference from the widely-used two-step hashing method is that the output representations of the learned deep model help update the similarity graph matrix, which is then used to improve the subsequent code optimization. In addition, for producing high-quality binary codes, we devise an effective discrete optimization algorithm which can directly handle the binary constraints with a general hashing loss.

While controllable hydrodynamic chaos has previously been observed in viscous fluids and harnessed for efficient mixing, its application to the manipulation of digital information has been sparsely investigated. We show that chaotic stirring of a viscous fluid naturally produces a characteristic signature of the stirring process in the arrangement of particles in the fluid, and that this signature directly satisfies the requirements for a cryptographic hash function. This includes strong divergence between similar stirring protocols\' hashes and avoidance of collisions (identical hashes from distinct stirs), which are facilitated by noninvertibility and a broad chaotic attractor that samples many points in the fluid domain. The hashing ability of the chaotic fluidic map implicates several unexpected mechanisms, including incomplete mixing at short time scales that produces a hyperuniform hash distribution. We investigate the dynamics of hashing using interparticle winding statistics, and find that hashing starts with large-scale winding of kinetically disjoint regions of the chaotic attractor, which gradually gives way to smaller scale braiding of single-particle trajectories. In addition to providing a physically motivated approach to implementing and analyzing deterministic chaotic maps for cryptographic applications, we anticipate that our approach has applications in microfluidic proof-of-work systems and characterizing large-scale turbulent flows from sparse tracer data.', 'braiding;encryption;fluid dynamics;mixing;nonlinear dynamics', 'Department of Applied Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305 wgilpin@stanford.edu.;', 'United States', '10.1073/pnas.1721852115', '', '', '', '', '1', '', NULL, '');

This amounts to more than half the number of named species of flies for all of Central America. Specimens were collected with two Malaise traps running continuously and with a wide array of supplementary collecting methods for three days of each month. All morphospecies from all 73 families recorded were fully curated by technicians before submission to an international team of 59 taxonomic experts for identification.        Overall, a Malaise trap on the forest edge captured 1,988 species or 51% of all collected dipteran taxa (other than of Phoridae, subsampled only from this and one other Malaise trap). A Malaise trap in the forest sampled 906 species. Of other sampling methods, the combination of four other Malaise traps and an intercept trap, aerial/hand collecting, 10 emergence traps, and four CDC light traps added the greatest number of species to our inventory.

Current research into overcoming the problem of fake news does not focus on establishing the ownership of media resources used in such stories-the blockchain-based application introduced in this article is technology that is capable of indicating the authenticity of digital media. Put simply, using the trust mechanisms of blockchain technology, the tool can show, beyond doubt, the provenance of any source of digital media, including images used out of context in attempts to mislead.

Water saving traits are critical for water stress adaptation of pearl millet, whereas maximizing water use is key to the absence of stress. This research aimed at demonstrating the close relationship between traits measured at different levels of plant organization, some putatively involved in water stress adaptation, and those responsible for agronomic performance. A fine-mapping population of pearl millet, segregating for a previously identified quantitative trait locus (QTL) for adaptation to terminal drought stress on LG02, was phenotyped for traits at different levels of plant organization in different experimental environments (pot culture, high-throughput phenotyping platform, lysimeters, and field). The linkages among traits across the experimental systems were analysed using principal component analysis and QTL co-localization approach. Four regions within the LG02-QTL were found and revealed substantial co-mapping of water use and agronomic traits. These regions, identified across experimental systems, provided genetic evidence of the tight linkages between traits phenotyped at a lower level of plant organization and agronomic traits assessed in the field, therefore deepening our understanding of complex traits and then benefiting both geneticists and breeders. In short: (1) under no/mild stress conditions, increasing biomass and tiller production increased water use and eventually yield; (2) under severe stress conditions, water savings at vegetative stage, from lower plant vigour and fewer tillers in that population, led to more water available during grain filling, expression of stay-green phenotypes, and higher yield.', '', 'Crop Physiology Laboratory, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, Telangana, 502324, India.;Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamilnadu, 620 024, India.;Crop Physiology Laboratory, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, Telangana, 502324, India.;Crop Physiology Laboratory, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, Telangana, 502324, India.;Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamilnadu, 620 024, India.;International Center for Maize and Wheat Improvement (CIMMYT), Km. 45, Carretera Mex-Veracruz, El Batan, CP 56237, Texcoco, Mexico.;ICRISAT Sahelian Center, Pearl Millet Breeding, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), BP 1204, Niamey, Niger.;Crop Physiology Laboratory, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, Telangana, 502324, India.;Crop Physiology Laboratory, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, Telangana, 502324, India.;Crop Physiology Laboratory, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, Telangana, 502324, India.;Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamilnadu, 620 024, India.;Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences (IBERS), Aberystwyth University, Aberystwyth, SY23 3EB, UK.;Crop Physiology Laboratory, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Patancheru, Telangana, 502324, India. v.vadez@cgiar.org.;Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD), Université de Montpellier, UMR DIADE, 911 Avenue Agropolis, BP 64501, 34394, Montpellier Cedex 5, France. v.vadez@cgiar.org.;', 'Germany', '10.1007/s00122-018-3094-6', '', '', '', '', '1', '', NULL, '');

Then, it tailors a graph hashing method to explore the underlying structure between GO terms and to obtain a series of hash functions to compress the high-dimensional protein-term association matrix into a low-dimensional one. Next, HashGO computes the semantic similarity between proteins based on Hamming distance on that low-dimensional matrix. After that, it predicts missing annotations of a protein based on the annotations of its semantic neighbors. Experimental results on archived GO annotations of two model species (Yeast and Human) show that HashGO not only more accurately predicts functions than other related approaches, but also runs faster than them.', 'Gene ontology;Graph hashing;Protein function prediction;Semantic similarity', 'College of Computer and Information Science, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.;College of Computer and Information Science, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.;College of Computer and Information Science, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.;College of Computer and Information Science, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.

NewSQL is an emerging database system and is now being used more and more widely. NewSQL systems need to improve data reliability by periodically backing up in-memory data, resulting in a lot of duplicated data. The traditional deduplication method is not optimized for the NewSQL server system and cannot take full advantage of hardware resources to optimize deduplication performance. A recent research pointed out that the future NewSQL server will have thousands of CPU cores, large DRAM and huge NVRAM. Therefore, how to utilize these hardware resources to optimize the performance of data deduplication is an important issue. To solve this problem, we propose a deduplication optimization method (DOMe) for NewSQL system backup. To take advantage of the large number of CPU cores in the NewSQL server to optimize deduplication performance, DOMe parallelizes the deduplication method based on the fork-join framework. The fingerprint index, which is the key data structure in the deduplication process, is implemented as pure in-memory hash table, which makes full use of the large DRAM in NewSQL system, eliminating the performance bottleneck problem of fingerprint index existing in traditional deduplication method. The H-store is used as a typical NewSQL database system to implement DOMe method. DOMe is experimentally analyzed by two representative backup data. The experimental results show that: 1) DOMe can reduce the duplicated NewSQL backup data. 2) DOMe significantly improves deduplication performance by parallelizing CDC algorithms. In the case of the theoretical speedup ratio of the server is 20.8, the speedup ratio of DOMe can achieve up to 18; 3) DOMe improved the deduplication throughput by 1.5 times through the pure in-memory index optimization method.', '', 'The School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\'an Jiaotong University, Xi\'an, Shaanxi, 710049 P.R.

Unlike the standard LSH which only utilizes the linear distance calculation, in CFLSH, the short-listing step from a pool of pre-selected candidates filtered by hash functions to the final nearest neighbor set relies upon the frequency of collision along with distance information. We evaluate CFLSH versus the standard LSH using the L1 and cosine distances, for predicting acute hypotensive episodes on arterial blood pressure time series data extracted from the MIMIC II database.

In this paper, we propose a unified and concise unsupervised hashing framework, called binary multidimensional scaling, which is able to learn the hash code for distance preservation in both batch and online mode. In the batch mode, unlike most existing hashing methods, we do not need to simplify the model by predefining the form of hash map. Instead, we learn the binary codes directly based on the pairwise distances among the normalized original features by alternating minimization. This enables a stronger expressive power of the hash map. In the online mode, we consider the holistic distance relationship between current query example and those we have already learned, rather than only focusing on current data chunk.

Recently, researchers have started investigating approaches to decoding which omit the spike sorting step, by directly using information about action potentials\' waveform shapes in the decoder, though this approach is not yet widespread. Particularly, one recent approach involves computing the moments of waveform features and using these moment values as inputs to decoders. This computationally inexpensive approach was shown to be comparable in accuracy to traditional spike sorting. In this study, we use offline data recorded from two Rhesus monkeys to further validate this approach. We also modify this approach by using sums of exponentiated features of spikes, rather than moments. Our results show that using waveform feature sums facilitates significantly higher hand movement reconstruction accuracy than using waveform feature moments, though the magnitudes of differences are small. We find that using the sums of one simple feature, the spike amplitude, allows better offline decoding accuracy than traditional spike sorting by expert (correlation of 0.767, 0.785 vs. 0.744, 0.738, respectively, for two monkeys, average 16% reduction in mean-squared-error), as well as unsorted threshold crossings (0.746, 0.776; average 9% reduction in mean-squared-error). Our results suggest that the sums-of-features framework has potential as an alternative to both spike sorting and using unsorted threshold crossings, if developed further. Also, we present data comparing sorted vs. unsorted spike counts in terms of offline decoding accuracy. Traditional sorted spike counts do not include waveforms that do not match any template (\"hash\"), but threshold crossing counts do include this hash. On our data and in previous work, hash contributes to decoding accuracy.

By transforming high-dimensional features to binary codes, the original Euclidean distance is approximated via Hamming distance. More recently, it is advocated that it is the manifold distance, rather than the Euclidean distance, that should be preserved in the Hamming space. However, it retains as an open problem to directly preserve the manifold structure by hashing. In particular, it first needs to build the local linear embedding in the original feature space, and then quantize such embedding to binary codes. Such a two-step coding is problematic and less optimized. Besides, the off-line learning is extremely time and memory consuming, which needs to calculate the similarity matrix of the original data. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing algorithm, termed discrete locality linear embedding hashing (DLLH), which well addresses the above challenges. The DLLH directly reconstructs the manifold structure in the Hamming space, which learns optimal hash codes to maintain the local linear relationship of data points. To learn discrete locally linear embeddingcodes, we further propose a discrete optimization algorithm with an iterative parameters updating scheme. Moreover, an anchor-based acceleration scheme, termed Anchor-DLLH, is further introduced, which approximates the large similarity matrix by the product of two low-rank matrices.

While widely used, alpha testing has a long-standing problem: geometry can disappear entirely as alpha mapped polygons recede with distance. As foveated rendering for virtual reality spreads, this problem worsens as peripheral minification and prefiltering introduce this problem on nearby objects. We first introduce the notion of stochastic alpha testing, which replaces a fixed alpha threshold of ατ = 0.5 with a randomly chosen ατ ∈ [0..1). This entirely avoids the problem of disappearing alpha-tested geometry, but introduces temporal noise. Hashed alpha testing uses a hash function to choose ατ procedurally. With a good hash function and inputs, hashed alpha testing maintains distant geometry without introducing more temporal flicker than traditional alpha testing. We also describe how hashed alpha interacts with temporal antialiasing and applies to alpha-to-coverage and screen-door transparency. Because hashed alpha testing addresses alpha test aliasing by introducing stable sampling, it has implications in other domains where increased sample stability is desirable.

Next, the perceptual hash algorithm is employed to measure the similarity of representative frames. As a result, the key frame set is obtained after filtering out similar frames from the representative frame set. Finally, the video summary is constructed by assigning the key frames in temporal order.

For product identification, tracking and real-time awareness, RFID tags are attached to goods. As tagged goods move along the supply chain from the suppliers to the manufacturers, and then on to the retailers until eventually they reach the customers, two major security challenges can be identified: (I) to protect the shipment of goods that are controlled by potentially untrusted carriers; and (II) to secure the transfer of ownership at each stage of the chain. For the former, grouping proofs in which the tags of the scanned goods generate a proof of \"simulatenous\" presence can be employed, while for the latter, ownership transfer protocols (OTP) are used. This paper describes enhanced security solutions for both challenges. We first extend earlier work on grouping proofs and group codes to capture resilient group scanning with untrusted readers; then, we describe a modified version of a recently published OTP based on channels with positive secrecy capacity adapted to be implemented on common RFID systems in the supply chain.

In this paper, we study spectral hashing (SH), which is a classical method of unsupervised hashing. In general, SH solves for the hash codes by minimizing an objective function that tries to preserve the similarity structure of the data given. Although computationally simple, very often SH performs unsatisfactorily and lags distinctly behind the state-of-the-art methods. We observe that the inferior performance of SH is mainly due to its imperfect formulation; that is, the optimization of the minimization problem in SH actually cannot ensure that the similarity structure of the high-dimensional data is really preserved in the low-dimensional hash code space. In this paper, we, therefore, introduce reversed SH (ReSH), which is SH with its input and output interchanged. Unlike SH, which estimates the similarity structure from the given high-dimensional data, our ReSH defines the similarities between data points according to the unknown low-dimensional hash codes.

More precisely, the minimization problem in our ReSH can be optimized if and only if similar data points are mapped to adjacent hash codes, and mostly important, dissimilar data points are considerably separated from each other in the code space.

To reduce sensitivity to scale changes for mapping objects that are far apart from each other, Student t-distribution is used to estimate the similarity between the relaxed hash code vectors for keyframes. This results in more accurate preservation of the desired unsupervised similarity structure in the hash code space. By adapting the corresponding optimization objective and constructing the hash mapping function via a deep neural network, we develop a robust unsupervised training strategy for a deep hashing network.

To combat with this challenge, we introduce a Gene Ontology Hierarchy Preserving Hashing (HPHash) based semantic method for gene function prediction. HPHash firstly measures the taxonomic similarity between GO terms. It then uses a hierarchy preserving hashing technique to keep the hierarchical order between GO terms, and to optimize a series of hashing functions to encode massive GO terms via compact binary codes.

In this study, we dissect the strategies employed by matching systems to tackle the challenges of matching biomedical ontologies and gauge the impact of the challenges themselves on matching performance, using the AgreementMakerLight (AML) system as the platform for this study.;We demonstrate that the linear complexity of the hash-based searching strategy implemented by most state-of-the-art ontology matching systems is essential for matching large biomedical ontologies efficiently. We show that accounting for all lexical annotations (e.g., labels and synonyms) in biomedical ontologies leads to a substantial improvement in F-measure over using only the primary name, and that accounting for the reliability of different types of annotations generally also leads to a marked improvement. Finally, we show that cross-references are a reliable source of information and that, when using biomedical ontologies as background knowledge, it is generally more reliable to use them as mediators than to perform lexical expansion.;We anticipate that translating traditional matching algorithms to the hash-based searching paradigm will be a critical direction for the future development of the field. Improving the evaluation carried out in the biomedical tracks of the OAEI will also be important, as without proper reference alignments there is only so much that can be ascertained about matching systems or strategies.

However, these methods ignore the discriminative property in hash learning process, which results in hash codes from different classes undistinguished, and therefore reduces the accuracy and robustness for the nearest neighbor search.

First, the proposed method formulates the hash function learning in terms of classification, where the binary codes generated by the learned hash functions are expected to be discriminative.

Finally, the learned structures are preserved for hash codes to produce similar binary codes in the same class.

In this work, we analyze how to perform vertex partitioning on massive graphs of tens of millions of nodes.

This approach has an apparent quadratic complexity since, upon removal of a node and adjoining set of edges, the node degree calculations must be updated prior to choosing the next node. However, we describe a linear time complexity solution using an array whose indices map to node degree and whose values are hash tables indicating the presence or absence of a node at that degree value. This approach also has a linear growth with respect to memory usage which is surprising since we lowered the time complexity from quadratic to linear.

We conducted feeding trials with captive brown bears (Ursus arctos) and polar bears (Ursus maritimus). As dietary lipid content increased to ∼90%, we observed increasing differences between blood plasma and diets that had not been lipid extracted (∆(13)Ctissue-bulk diet) and slightly decreasing differences between plasma δ(13)C and lipid-extracted diet.

In order to solve such problems, virtual reality based vascular interventional surgery training system, a promising way to train young surgeons or assist experienced surgeons to perform surgery, has been widely studied.;In this paper, we mainly conduct a thorough study on both reliable deformation and high real-time performance of an interactive surgery training system. An efficient hybrid geometric blood vessel model which handles the collision detection query and vascular deformation calculation separately is employed to enhance the real-time performance of our surgery training system. In addition, a position-based dynamic approach with volume conservation constraint is used to improve the vascular deformation result. Finally, a hash table based spatial adaptive acceleration algorithm which makes the training system much more efficient and reliable is described.;Several necessary experiments are conducted to validate the vascular deformation scheme presented in this paper. From the results we can see that the position-based dynamic modeling method with volume conservation constraint can prevent the vascular deformation from the issue of penetration.

In these large-scale and dynamic overlays, it incurs significant communication and computation cost to discover a sufficiently large relay candidate set and further to select one relay with good performance.

Traditional SDH decomposes the optimization into three sub-problems, with the most critical sub-problem - discrete optimization for binary hash codes - solved using iterative discrete cyclic coordinate descent (DCC), which is time-consuming. However, FSDH has a closed-form solution and only requires a single rather than iterative hash code-solving step, which is highly efficient. Furthermore, FSDH is usually faster than SDH for solving the projection matrix for least squares regression, making FSDH generally faster than SDH. For example, our results show that FSDH is about 12-times faster than SDH when the number of hashing bits is 128 on the CIFAR-10 data base, and FSDH is about 151-times faster than FastHash when the number of hashing bits is 64 on the MNIST data-base. Our experimental results show that FSDH is not only fast, but also outperforms other comparative methods.', '', '', 'United States', '10.1109/TPAMI.2017.2678475', '', '', '', '', '1', '', NULL, '');

The core problem of cross-modal hashing is how to learn compact binary codes that construct the underlying correlations between heterogeneous features from different modalities. A majority of recent approaches aim at learning hash functions to preserve the pairwise similarities defined by given class labels. However, these methods fail to explicitly explore the discriminative property of class labels during hash function learning. In addition, they usually discard the discrete constraints imposed on the to-be-learned binary codes, and compromise to solve a relaxed problem with quantization to obtain the approximate binary solution. Therefore, the binary codes generated by these methods are suboptimal and less discriminative to different classes. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel cross-modal hashing method, termed discrete cross-modal hashing (DCH), which directly learns discriminative binary codes while retaining the discrete constraints. Specifically, DCH learns modality-specific hash functions for generating unified binary codes, and these binary codes are viewed as representative features for discriminative classification with class labels. An effective discrete optimization algorithm is developed for DCH to jointly learn the modality-specific hash function and the unified binary codes. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets highlight the superiority of DCH under various cross-modal scenarios and show its state-of-the-art performance.', '', '', 'United States', '10.1109/TIP.2017.2676345', '', '', '', '', '1', '', NULL, '');

The pendulum that has been swinging toward narrow specialization is swinging the other way, as many trained subspecialists are having a harder time finding positions after fellowship, and if they do find a position, the majority of their practice can actually be advanced GI surgery and not exclusively their area of focused expertise. Many hospitals/practices desire surgeons who are competent and specifically credentialed to perform a variety of advanced GI procedures from the esophagus through the anus. Furthermore, broader exposure in training may provide complementary and overlapping skills that may lead to an even better trained GI surgeon compared to someone whose experience is limited to just the liver and pancreas, or to just the colon and rectum, or to only bariatric and foregut surgery. With work hour restrictions and limitations on autonomy for current trainees in residency, many senior trainees have not developed the skills and knowledge to allow them to be competent and comfortable in the broad range of GI surgery. Such training should reflect the needs of the patients and their diseases, and reflect what many practicing surgeons are currently doing, and what many trainees say they would like to do, if there were such fellowship pathways available to them. The goal is to train advanced GI surgeons who are competent and proficient to operate throughout the GI tract and abdomen with open, laparoscopic, and endoscopic techniques in acute and elective situations in a broad variety of complex GI diseases. The program may be standalone, or prepare a surgeon for additional subspecialty training (transition to fellowship and/or to practice). This group of surgeons should be distinguished from subspecialist surgeons who focus in a narrow area of GI surgery. Advanced GI surgery training could occupy the area between general surgery residency and further subspecialty training as seen in the graph below. Visually, we are trying to define the red hash mark area. This is challenging as the inner border with core general surgery is ill defined and interpreted differently by various stakeholders. Similarly, the outer border of the red hash marks, which defines areas that require a surgical subspecialist, is also not clear. Inevitably, overlap exists in the care of these patients and is influenced by the complexity of the underlying disease presentations. The concept is noble, but the future is unclear. Challenges and uncertainties include whether the Certificate of Focused Expertise will go forward, and what the RRC and ABS might decide on the structure of General Surgery training. Funding and the ability to offer autonomy during training are additional challenges in today\'s training environment. Currently, the ABS is considering a \"Core Plus\" concept, though what is \"the Core\" and what is the \"Plus\" are not yet determined, and these concepts have been promoted for years. Whether training becomes 4 +1, or 4 +1+1, 5+1 or some other model continues to be discussed. We, the Task Force of Advanced GI Surgery Training, have drafted a vision of what advanced GI training could/should look like to help guide the ABMS/ABS/RRC/ACGME as they contemplate surgery residency redesign goals.

Moreover, SSDH performs joint learning of image representations, hash codes, and classification in a point-wised manner, and thus is scalable to large-scale datasets.

The obtained problem is then efficiently solved by an iterative procedure with each iteration admitting an analytical discrete solution, which is thus shown to converge very fast.

Specifically, the latter probability distribution is derived from all pair-wise Hamming distances between to-be-learnt hash codes of the training data.

One of the significant unmet needs in veterinary surgery and pain management is for longer acting opioids for cats to effectively bridge the gap between the in-hospital and at-home recovery periods. A proof of concept study of an extended release formulation of buprenorphine HCL (ER-Bup) was conducted using objective kinetic measures and a unilateral onychectomy model. Using a blinded, randomized, two period crossover design, four cats were allocated to control (saline) or ER-Bup (0.6 mg/kg, subcutaneously [SC]) treatment groups. All animals underwent a unilateral forelimb onychectomy per period with a washout/recovery period in between. Observational pain scores and kinetic data (using a pressure sensitive walkway [PSW]) were collected prior to (baseline) and at intervals for 72 h following surgery. Symmetry indices were derived for kinetic variables (peak vertical force [PVF]; vertical impulse [VI]) of each forelimb for landing following a jump and for walking. A rescue analgesic protocol was in place. Effect of surgery and treatment were evaluated using a mixed model statistical approach.;No cats required rescue analgesics based on subjective pain score. ER-Bup had a positive influence on subjective pain scores during the 72 h postsurgery (p = 0.0473). PVF and VI of the operated limb were significantly decreased for both landing (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001) and walking (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001 respectively) compared to control. ER-Bup resulted in significantly decreased asymmetry in limb use during landing (PVF, p < 0.0001; VI, p < 0.0001) and walking (PVF, p = 0.0002, VI, p < 0.0001). The novel use of data collected following a jump from an elevated platform appeared to provide all desired information and was easier to collect than walking data.;This study demonstrates that SC administration of ER-Bup may be an effective analgesic for a 72 h period postoperatively.

Despite simplicity and efficiency, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has never been recognized as a good way to generate such codes due to its poor performance in traditional approximate neighbor search. We claim in this paper that the true merit of LSH lies in transforming the semantic labels to obtain the binary codes, resulting in an effective and efficient two-step hashing framework. Specifically, we developed the locality-sensitive two-step hashing (LS-TSH) that generates the binary codes through LSH rather than any complex optimization technique. Theoretically, with proper assumption, LS-TSH is actually a useful LSH scheme, so that it preserves the label-based semantic similarity and possesses sublinear query complexity for hash lookup.

Existing SH methods mostly focus on finding better sparse representations of images in the hash space. We argue that the anchor set utilized in sparse representation is also crucial, which was unfortunately underestimated by the prior art. To this end, we propose a novel SH method that optimizes the integration of the anchors, such that the features can be better embedded and binarized, termed as Sparse Hashing with Optimized Anchor Embedding. The central idea is to push the anchors far from the axis while preserving their relative positions so as to generate similar hashcodes for neighboring features.

The flowchart can be elaborated as follows. Given an aerial photo, we first extract a number of graphlets to describe its topological structure. For each graphlet, we utilize color and texture to capture its appearance, and a weakly supervised algorithm to capture its semantics. Thereafter, aerial photo categorization can be naturally formulated as graphlet-to-graphlet matching. As the number of graphlets from each aerial photo is huge, to accelerate matching, we present a hashing algorithm to seamlessly fuze the multiple visual features into binary codes. Finally, an image kernel is calculated by fast matching the binary codes corresponding to each graphlet. And a multi-class SVM is learned for aerial photo categorization.

A hetero-manifold integrates multiple sub-manifolds defined by homogeneous data with the help of cross-modal supervision information. Taking advantages of the hetero-manifold, the similarity between each pair of heterogeneous data could be naturally measured by three order random walks on this hetero-manifold. Furthermore, a novel cumulative distance inequality defined on the hetero-manifold is introduced to avoid the computational difficulty induced by the discreteness of hash codes. By using the inequality, cross-modal hashing is transformed into a problem of hetero-manifold regularised support vector learning. Therefore, the performance of cross-modal search can be significantly improved by seamlessly combining the integrated information of the hetero-manifold and the strong generalisation of the support vector machine.

Rapid human population growth and stagnating crop yields greatly contribute to this fact. Poor soil fertility, especially low plant available phosphorus (P) is constraining food production in the region. P-fertilizer use in WA is among the lowest in the world due to inaccessibility and high prices, often unaffordable to resource-poor subsistence farmers. This article provides an overview of soil P-deficiency in WA and opportunities to overcome it by exploiting sorghum and pearl millet genetic diversity. The topic is examined from the perspectives of plant breeding, soil science, plant physiology, plant nutrition, and agronomy, thereby referring to recent results obtained in a joint interdisciplinary research project, and reported literature. Specific objectives are to summarize: (1) The global problem of P scarcity and how it will affect WA farmers; (2) Soil P dynamics in WA soils; (3) Plant responses to P deficiency; (4) Opportunities to breed for improved crop adaptation to P-limited conditions; (5) Challenges and trade-offs for improving sorghum and pearl millet adaptation to low-P conditions in WA; and (6) Systems approaches to address soil P-deficiency in WA. Sorghum and pearl millet in WA exhibit highly significant genetic variation for P-uptake efficiency, P-utilization efficiency, and grain yield under P-limited conditions indicating the possibility of breeding P-efficient varieties. Direct selection under P-limited conditions was more efficient than indirect selection under high-P conditions. Combining P-uptake and P-utilization efficiency is recommendable for WA to avoid further soil mining. Genomic regions responsible for P-uptake, P-utilization efficiency, and grain yield under low-P have been identified in WA sorghum and pearl millet, and marker-assisted selection could be possible once these genomic regions are validated. Developing P-efficient genotypes may not, however, be a sustainable solution in itself in the long-term without replenishing the P removed from the system in harvested produce. We therefore propose the use of integrated soil fertility management and systems-oriented management such as enhanced crop-tree-livestock integration in combination with P-use-efficiency-improved varieties.

Unlike existing cross-modal hashing algorithms where the learned hash functions are binary space partitioning functions, such as the sign and threshold function, the proposed hashing scheme takes advantage of a new class of hash functions closely related to rank correlation measures which are known to be scale-invariant, numerically stable, and highly nonlinear. Specifically, we jointly learn two groups of linear subspaces, one for each modality, so that features\' ranking orders in different linear subspaces maximally preserve the cross-modal similarities. We show that the ranking-based hash function has a natural probabilistic approximation which transforms the original highly discontinuous optimization problem into one that can be efficiently solved using simple gradient descent algorithms. The proposed hashing framework is also flexible in the sense that the optimization procedures are not tied up to any specific form of loss function, which is typical for existing cross-modal hashing methods, but rather we can flexibly accommodate different loss functions with minimal changes to the learning steps.

Inspired by this, in this paper, we introduce a novel supervised cross-modality hashing framework, which can generate unified binary codes for instances represented in different modalities. Particularly, in the learning phase, each bit of a code can be sequentially learned with a discrete optimization scheme that jointly minimizes its empirical loss based on a boosting strategy. In a bitwise manner, hash functions are then learned for each modality, mapping the corresponding representations into unified hash codes. We regard this approach as cross-modality sequential discrete hashing (CSDH), which can effectively reduce the quantization errors arisen in the oversimplified rounding-off step and thus lead to high-quality binary codes. In the test phase, a simple fusion scheme is utilized to generate a unified hash code for final retrieval by merging the predicted hashing results of an unseen instance from different modalities.

A malicious node can send a spoofing reply to prevent the address configuration of a normal node, and thus, a denial-of-service attack is launched. This study proposes a hash method to hide the target address in DAD, which prevents an attack node from launching destination attacks. If the address of a normal node is identical to the detection address, then its hash value should be the same as the \"Hash_64\" field in the neighboring solicitation message. Consequently, DAD can be successfully completed. This process is called DAD-h.

To effectively preserve the similarities of semi-paired data in the latent subspace, we construct the cross-view similarity graph with the help of anchor data pairs. SPDH jointly learns the latent features and hash codes with a factorization-based coding scheme. For the formulated objective function, we devise an efficient alternating optimization algorithm, where the key binary code learning problem is solved in a bit-by-bit manner with each bit generated with a closed-form solution.

Integrity is provided in two levels: strict integrity implemented by a cryptographic hash watermark, and content-based integrity implemented by a symmetric encryption-based tamper localization scheme. Confidentiality is achieved as a byproduct of hiding patient\'s data in the image. Performance of the algorithm was evaluated with respect to imperceptibility, robustness, capacity, and tamper localization, using different medical images. The results showed the effectiveness of the algorithm in providing security for telemedicine applications.', 'Authenticity;Confidentiality;DICOM standard;DWT;Digital watermarking;Integrity;SVD;Tamper localization;Telemedicine security', 'Department of Computer Engineering, King Abdullah II Faculty of Engineering, Princess Sumaya University for Technology, Al-Jubeiha, P.O.

To accommodate the increasing need of analyzing very large NGS data sets, it is necessary to develop faster, more sensitive and accurate mapping tools.;HIA uses two indices, a hash table index and a suffix array index. The hash table performs direct lookup of a q-gram, and the suffix array performs very fast lookup of variable-length strings by exploiting binary search. We observed that combining hash table and suffix array (hybrid index) is much faster than the suffix array method for finding a substring in the reference sequence. Here, we defined the matching region (MR) is a longest common substring between a reference and a read. And, we also defined the candidate alignment regions (CARs) as a list of MRs that is close to each other. The hybrid index is used to find candidate alignment regions (CARs) between a reference and a read. We found that aligning only the unmatched regions in the CAR is much faster than aligning the whole CAR. In benchmark analysis, HIA outperformed in mapping speed compared with the other aligners, without significant loss of mapping accuracy.;Our experiments show that the hybrid of hash table and suffix array is useful in terms of speed for mapping NGS sequencing reads to the human reference genome sequence.

In practice, multiple hash tables are usually built using hashing to cover more desired results in the hit buckets of each table. However, rare work studies the unified approach to constructing multiple informative hash tables using any type of hashing algorithms. Meanwhile, for multiple table search, it also lacks of a generic query-adaptive and fine-grained ranking scheme that can alleviate the binary quantization loss suffered in the standard hashing techniques. To solve the above problems, in this paper, we first regard the table construction as a selection problem over a set of candidate hash functions. With the graph representation of the function set, we propose an efficient solution that sequentially applies normalized dominant set to finding the most informative and independent hash functions for each table. To further reduce the redundancy between tables, we explore the reciprocal hash tables in a boosting manner, where the hash function graph is updated with high weights emphasized on the misclassified neighbor pairs of previous hash tables. To refine the ranking of the retrieved buckets within a certain Hamming radius from the query, we propose a query-adaptive bitwise weighting scheme to enable fine-grained bucket ranking in each hash table, exploiting the discriminative power of its hash functions and their complement for nearest neighbor search. Moreover, we integrate such scheme into the multiple table search using a fast, yet reciprocal table lookup algorithm within the adaptive weighted Hamming radius. In this paper, both the construction method and the query-adaptive search method are general and compatible with different types of hashing algorithms using different feature spaces and/or parameter settings. Our extensive experiments on several large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed techniques can significantly outperform both the naive construction methods and the state-of-the-art hashing algorithms.

While sufficient for single-site and limited-scale studies, the use of common unique study identifiers has several drawbacks for large multicenter studies, where thousands of research participants may be recruited from multiple sites. An important property of study identifiers is error tolerance (or validatable), in that inadvertent editing mistakes during their transmission and use will most likely result in invalid study identifiers.;This paper introduces a novel method called \"Randomized N-gram Hashing (NHash),\" for generating unique study identifiers in a distributed and validatable fashion, in multicenter research. NHash has a unique set of properties: (1) it is a pseudonym serving the purpose of linking research data about a study participant for research purposes; (2) it can be generated automatically in a completely distributed fashion with virtually no risk for identifier collision; (3) it incorporates a set of cryptographic hash functions based on N-grams, with a combination of additional encryption techniques such as a shift cipher; (d) it is validatable (error tolerant) in the sense that inadvertent edit errors will mostly result in invalid identifiers.;NHash consists of 2 phases. First, an intermediate string using randomized N-gram hashing is generated. This string consists of a collection of N-gram hashes f1, f2, ..., fk. The input for each function fi has 3 components: a random number r, an integer n, and input data m. The result, fi(r, n, m), is an n-gram of m with a starting position s, which is computed as (r mod |m|), where |m| represents the length of m. The output for Step 1 is the concatenation of the sequence f1(r1, n1, m1), f2(r2, n2, m2), ..., fk(rk, nk, mk). In the second phase, the intermediate string generated in Phase 1 is encrypted using techniques such as shift cipher. The result of the encryption, concatenated with the random number r, is the final NHash study identifier.;We performed experiments using a large synthesized dataset comparing NHash with random strings, and demonstrated neglegible probability for collision. We implemented NHash for the Center for SUDEP Research (CSR), a National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke-funded Center Without Walls for Collaborative Research in the Epilepsies.

Most existing approaches apply a single form of hash function, and an optimization process which is typically deeply coupled to this specific form. This tight coupling restricts the flexibility of those methods, and can result in complex optimization problems that are difficult to solve. In this work we proffer a flexible yet simple framework that is able to accommodate different types of loss functions and hash functions. The proposed framework allows a number of existing approaches to hashing to be placed in context, and simplifies the development of new problem-specific hashing methods. Our framework decomposes the hashing learning problem into two steps: binary code (hash bit) learning and hash function learning. The first step can typically be formulated as binary quadratic problems, and the second step can be accomplished by training a standard binary classifier. For solving large-scale binary code inference, we show how it is possible to ensure that the binary quadratic problems are submodular such that efficient graph cut methods may be used. To achieve efficiency as well as efficacy on large-scale high-dimensional data, we propose to use boosted decision trees as the hash functions, which are nonlinear, highly descriptive, and are very fast to train and evaluate.

Since color is an important visual clue to distinguish objects from background, we calculate the color similarity between objects in the previous frames and the candidates in current frame, which is adopted as color attention to tune the local sparse representation-based appearance similarity measurement between the object template and candidates. The color similarity can be calculated efficiently with hash coded color names, which helps the tracker find more reliable objects during tracking. We use a flexible local sparse coding of the object to evaluate the degeneration degree of the appearance model, based on which we build a model updating mechanism to alleviate drifting caused by temporal varying multi-factors. Experiments on 76 challenging benchmark color sequences and the evaluation under the object tracking benchmark protocol demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tracker over the state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.

To address these issues, we propose a supervised learning framework to generate compact and bit-scalable hashing codes directly from raw images. We pose hashing learning as a problem of regularized similarity learning. In particular, we organize the training images into a batch of triplet samples, each sample containing two images with the same label and one with a different label. With these triplet samples, we maximize the margin between the matched pairs and the mismatched pairs in the Hamming space. In addition, a regularization term is introduced to enforce the adjacency consistency, i.e., images of similar appearances should have similar codes. The deep convolutional neural network is utilized to train the model in an end-to-end fashion, where discriminative image features and hash functions are simultaneously optimized. Furthermore, each bit of our hashing codes is unequally weighted, so that we can manipulate the code lengths by truncating the insignificant bits. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-arts on public benchmarks of similar image search and also achieves promising results in the application of person re-identification in surveillance.

Therefore, we propose a probabilistic-based hashing framework to model multiple cues of cells for accurate analysis of histopathological images. Specifically, each cue of a cell is compressed as binary codes by kernelized and supervised hashing, and the importance of each hash entry is determined adaptively according to its discriminativity, which can be represented as probability scores. Given these scores, we also propose several feature fusion and selection schemes to integrate their strengths. The classification of the whole image is conducted by aggregating the results from multiple cues of all cells.

In the outward- and inward-facing states of the protein, the loops adopt different secondary structures, either wrapped to the end of an alpha-helix, or unwrapped to extended conformations. In equilibrium simulations of 100 ns with Mhp1 in explicit lipids and water, the loop conformations remain largely stable. In targeted molecular dynamics simulations with the protein structure driven from one state to the other, the loops exhibit resistance and only undergo abrupt changes when other parts of the protein already approach the target conformation. Free energy calculations on the isolated loops further confirm that the wrapping/unwrapping transitions are associated with substantial energetic barriers, and consist of multiple sequential steps involving the rotation of certain backbone torsion angles. Furthermore, in simulations with the loops driven from one state to the other, a large part of the protein follows the loops to the target conformation. Taken together, our simulations suggest that changes of the loop secondary structures would be among the slow degrees of freedom in the conformational transition of the entire protein. Incorporation of detailed loop structures into the reaction coordinate, therefore, should improve the convergence and relevance of the resulting conformational free energy.

It is important to understand genomic regions responsible for these traits. Here, F7 recombinant inbred lines were used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) and allelic interactions for traits affecting plant water use, and their relevance is discussed for crop productivity in water-limited environments. Four QTL contributed to increased transpiration rate under high vapour pressure deficit (VPD) conditions, all with alleles from drought-sensitive parent ICMB 841. Of these four QTL, a major QTL (35.7%) was mapped on linkage group (LG) 6. The alleles for 863B at this QTL decreased transpiration rate and this QTL co-mapped to a previously detected LG 6 QTL, with alleles from 863B for grain weight and panicle harvest index across severe terminal drought stress environments. This provided additional support for a link between water saving from a lower transpiration rate under high VPD and drought tolerance. 863B alleles in this same genomic region also increased shoot weight, leaf area and total transpiration under well-watered conditions. One unexpected outcome was reduced transpiration under high VPD (15%) from the interaction of two alleles for high VPD transpiration (LG 6 (B), 40.7) and specific leaf mass and biomass (LG 7 (A), 35.3), (A, allele from ICMB 841, B, allele from 863B, marker position).

The HIRAN domain has been hypothesized to play a role in DNA binding; however, the structural basis of, and functional evidence for, the HIRAN domain in DNA binding has remained unclear. Here we show for the first time the crystal structure of the HIRAN domain of human HLTF in complex with DNA. The HIRAN domain is composed of six β-strands and two α-helices, forming an OB-fold structure frequently found in ssDNA-binding proteins, including in replication factor A (RPA). Interestingly, this study reveals that the HIRAN domain interacts with not only with a single-stranded DNA but also with a duplex DNA. Furthermore, the structure unexpectedly clarifies that the HIRAN domain specifically recognizes the 3\'-end of DNA. These results suggest that the HIRAN domain functions as a sensor to the 3\'-end of the primer strand at the stalled replication fork and that the domain facilitates fork regression.

Moreover, novel methods for utilizing the one-way hash chain and constructing the personal secret, the revocation polynomial and the key updating broadcast packet are presented. Hence, the proposed OHC&amp;RP-SGKD schemes eliminate the limitation of the maximum allowed number of revoked users on the maximum allowed number of sessions, increase the maximum allowed number of revoked/colluding users, and reduce the redundancy in the key updating broadcast packet. Performance analysis and simulation results show that the proposed OHC&amp;RP-SGKD schemes are practical for resource-constrained wireless networks in bad environments, where a strong collusion attack resistance is required and many users could be revoked.

Reuse of individual health-related data faces several problems: Either a unique personal identifier, like social security number, is not available or non-unique person identifiable information, like names, are privacy protected and cannot be accessed. A solution to protect privacy in probabilistic record linkages is to encrypt these sensitive information. Unfortunately, encrypted hash codes of two names differ completely if the plain names differ only by a single character. Therefore, standard encryption methods cannot be applied. To overcome these challenges, we developed the Privacy Preserving Probabilistic Record Linkage (P3RL) method.;In this Privacy Preserving Probabilistic Record Linkage method we apply a three-party protocol, with two sites collecting individual data and an independent trusted linkage center as the third partner. Our method consists of three main steps: pre-processing, encryption and probabilistic record linkage. Data pre-processing and encryption are done at the sites by local personnel. To guarantee similar quality and format of variables and identical encryption procedure at each site, the linkage center generates semi-automated pre-processing and encryption templates. To retrieve information (i.e. data structure) for the creation of templates without ever accessing plain person identifiable information, we introduced a novel method of data masking. Sensitive string variables are encrypted using Bloom filters, which enables calculation of similarity coefficients. For date variables, we developed special encryption procedures to handle the most common date errors. The linkage center performs probabilistic record linkage with encrypted person identifiable information and plain non-sensitive variables.;In this paper we describe step by step how to link existing health-related data using encryption methods to preserve privacy of persons in the study.;Privacy Preserving Probabilistic Record linkage expands record linkage facilities in settings where a unique identifier is unavailable and/or regulations restrict access to the non-unique person identifiable information needed to link existing health-related data sets.

Due to the known dimensionality curse, the performance of most existing indexing structures degrades quickly as the feature dimensionality increases. Hashing methods, such as locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and its variants, have been widely used to achieve fast approximate similarity search by trading search quality for efficiency. However, most existing hashing methods make use of randomized algorithms to generate hash codes without considering the specific structural information in the data. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing method, namely, robust hashing with local models (RHLM), which learns a set of robust hash functions to map the high-dimensional data points into binary hash codes by effectively utilizing local structural information. In RHLM, for each individual data point in the training dataset, a local hashing model is learned and used to predict the hash codes of its neighboring data points. The local models from all the data points are globally aligned so that an optimal hash code can be assigned to each data point. After obtaining the hash codes of all the training data points, we design a robust method by employing l2,1 -norm minimization on the loss function to learn effective hash functions, which are then used to map each database point into its hash code. Given a query data point, the search process first maps it into the query hash code by the hash functions and then explores the buckets, which have similar hash codes to the query hash code. Extensive experimental results conducted on real-life datasets show that the proposed RHLM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of search quality and efficiency.

Accurate characterization of DNA methylation is essential for understanding genotype phenotype association, gene and environment interaction, diseases, and cancer. Aligning bisulfite short reads to a reference genome has been a challenging task. We compared five bisulfite short read mapping tools, BSMAP, Bismark, BS-Seeker, BiSS, and BRAT-BW, representing two classes of mapping algorithms (hash table and suffix/prefix tries). We examined their mapping efficiency (i.e., the percentage of reads that can be mapped to the genomes), usability, running time, and effects of changing default parameter settings using both real and simulated reads. We also investigated how preprocessing data might affect mapping efficiency. Conclusion. Among the five programs compared, in terms of mapping efficiency, Bismark performs the best on the real data, followed by BiSS, BSMAP, and finally BRAT-BW and BS-Seeker with very similar performance. If CPU time is not a constraint, Bismark is a good choice of program for mapping bisulfite treated short reads. Data quality impacts a great deal mapping efficiency. Although increasing the number of mismatches allowed can increase mapping efficiency, it not only significantly slows down the program, but also runs the risk of having increased false positives.

Recently, various approaches to MQ cryptography using reduced public keys have been studied. As a result of this, at CHES2011 (Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems, 2011), a small public key MQ scheme, was proposed, and its feasible implementation on an embedded microprocessor was reported at CHES2012. However, the implementation of a small private key MQ scheme was not reported. For efficient implementation, random number generators can contribute to reduce the key size, but the cost of using a random number generator is much more complex than computing MQ on modern microprocessors. Therefore, no feasible results have been reported on embedded microprocessors. In this paper, we propose a feasible implementation on embedded microprocessors for a small private key MQ scheme using a pseudo-random number generator and hash function based on a block-cipher exploiting a hardware Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) accelerator. To speed up the performance, we apply various implementation methods, including parallel computation, on-the-fly computation, optimized logarithm representation, vinegar monomials and assembly programming.

These models mostly have assumed an environment in which security has to be at a standard level.

Although this increases theoretical complexity, the savings in cache misses reduce the empirical running times.

Molecular markers have been used to identify genomic regions linked to traits of interest by conventional QTL mapping and association analysis. Phenotypic recurrent selection is known to increase frequencies of favorable alleles and decrease those unfavorable for the traits under selection. This study was undertaken (i) to quantify the response to recurrent selection for phenotypic traits during breeding of the pearl millet open-pollinated cultivar \"CO (Cu) 9\" and its four immediate progenitor populations and (ii) to assess the ability of simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker alleles to identify genomic regions linked to grain and stover yield-related traits in these populations by association analysis. A total of 159 SSR alleles were detected across 34 selected single-copy SSR loci. SSR marker data revealed presence of subpopulations. Association analysis identified genomic regions associated with flowering time located on linkage group (LG) 6 and plant height on LG4, LG6, and LG7. Marker alleles on LG6 were associated with stover yield, and those on LG7 were associated with grain yield. Findings of this study would give an opportunity to develop marker-assisted recurrent selection (MARS) or marker-assisted population improvement (MAPI) strategies to increase the rate of gain for pearl millet populations undergoing recurrent selection.

In the context of mobile sensing, P2PSIP protocols facilitate decentralized and fast communications with sensor-enabled terminals. Nevertheless, in order to make P2PSIP protocols feasible in mobile sensing networks, it is necessary to minimize overhead transmissions for signaling purposes, which reduces the battery lifetime. In this paper, we present a solution to improve the management of wireless overlay networks by defining an adaptive algorithm for the calculation of refresh time. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it takes into account new parameters, such as the delay between nodes, and provides satisfactory performance and reliability levels at a much lower management overhead than previous approaches.

The role of autophagy in tumor development is complex. Various studies suggest that autophagy mainly contributes to tumor suppression during the early stage of tumorigenesis and tumor promotion during the late stage of tumorigenesis. During the tumorization of normal cells, autophagy protects genomic stability by retarding stem cells-involved damage/repair cycle, and inhibits the formation of chronic inflammatory microenvironment, thus protecting normal cell homeostasis and preventing tumor generation. On the other hand, autophagy also protects tumor cells survival during malignant progression by supporting cellular metabolic demands, decreasing metabolic damage and supporting anoikis resistance and dormancy. Taken together, autophagy appears to play a role as a protector for either normal or tumor cells during the early or late stage of tumorigenesis, respectively. The process of tumorigenesis perhaps needs to undergo twice autophagy-associated screening. The normal cells that have lower autophagy capacity are prone to tumorization, and the incipient tumor cells that have higher autophagy capacity possibly are easier to survival in the hash microenvironment and accumulate more mutations to promote malignant progression.

Mean shell-hash content decreased rapidly at distances >5 m from the line and, over the distance 1-64 m, decreased by three orders of magnitude.

There was no evidence that mussel farming was associated with changes in macrobenthic diversity, species count or feeding strategy. However, total macrofaunal count was estimated to be 2.5 times higher in close proximity to the lines, compared with 64 m distance, and there was evidence that this effect was conditional on the presence of shell-hash.

This paper addresses an important open issue in the literature, i.e., how to learn compact hash codes by enhancing the complementarity among different hash functions. Most of prior studies solve this problem either by adopting time-consuming sequential learning algorithms or by generating the hash functions which are subject to some deliberately-designed constraints (e.g., enforcing hash functions orthogonal to one another). We analyze the drawbacks of past works and propose a new solution to this problem. Our idea is to decompose the feature space into a subspace shared by all hash functions and its complementary subspace. On one hand, the shared subspace, corresponding to the common structure across different hash functions, conveys most relevant information for the hashing task. Similar to data de-noising, irrelevant information is explicitly suppressed during hash function generation. On the other hand, in case that the complementary subspace also contains useful information for specific hash functions, the final form of our proposed hashing scheme is a compromise between these two kinds of subspaces. To make hash functions not only preserve the local neighborhood structure but also capture the global cluster distribution of the whole data, an objective function incorporating spectral embedding loss, binary quantization loss, and shared subspace contribution is introduced to guide the hash function learning. We propose an efficient alternating optimization method to simultaneously learn both the shared structure and the hash functions. Experimental results on three well-known benchmarks CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, and a-TRECVID demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods.

Each projection vector is a linear combination of multiple random vectors subject to p-stable distribution, in which the weights for the linear combination are learned based on the training data. An orthogonal matrix is then learned data-dependently for minimizing the thresholding error in quantization.

When a reference genome is available, effective compression can be achieved by first aligning the reads to the reference genome, and then encoding each read using the alignment position combined with the differences in the read relative to the reference. These reference-based methods have been shown to compress better than reference-free schemes, but the alignment step they require demands several hours of CPU time on a typical dataset, whereas reference-free methods can usually compress in minutes.;We present a new approach that achieves highly efficient compression by using a reference genome, but completely circumvents the need for alignment, affording a great reduction in the time needed to compress. In contrast to reference-based methods that first align reads to the genome, we hash all reads into Bloom filters to encode, and decode by querying the same Bloom filters using read-length subsequences of the reference genome. Further compression is achieved by using a cascade of such filters.;Our method, called BARCODE, runs an order of magnitude faster than reference-based methods, while compressing an order of magnitude better than reference-free methods, over a broad range of sequencing coverage. In high coverage (50-100 fold), compared to the best tested compressors, BARCODE saves 80-90% of the running time while only increasing space slightly.', '', '', 'England', '10.1186/1471-2105-15-S9-S7', '', '', '', '', '1', '', NULL, '');

The modular design of the database permits a rapid insertion of new parameters without requiring any changes in the database structure.

In addition, microRNAs played important roles in the process of this massive genetic circuitry rewiring.

This paper proposes a spatio-temporal data indexing method, named HBSTR-tree, which is a hybrid index structure comprising spatio-temporal R-tree, B*-tree and Hash table. To improve the index generation efficiency, rather than directly inserting trajectory points, we group consecutive trajectory points as nodes according to their spatio-temporal semantics and then insert them into spatio-temporal R-tree as leaf nodes. Hash table is used to manage the latest leaf nodes to reduce the frequency of insertion. A new spatio-temporal interval criterion and a new node-choosing sub-algorithm are also proposed to optimize spatio-temporal R-tree structures. In addition, a B*-tree sub-index of leaf nodes is built to query the trajectories of targeted objects efficiently. Furthermore, a database storage scheme based on a NoSQL-type DBMS is also proposed for the purpose of cloud storage.

In recent years, a large number of such mapping algorithms have been developed, all of which have in common that they require algorithms for aligning a vast number of reads to genomic or transcriptomic sequences. Although the FM-index based aligner Bowtie has become a de facto standard within mapping pipelines, a much larger number of possible alignment algorithms have been developed also including other variants of FM-index based aligners. Accordingly, developers and users of RNA-seq mapping pipelines have the choice among a large number of available alignment algorithms.

Our results clearly showed the significant reduction in memory footprint and runtime provided by FM-index based aligners at a precision and recall comparable to the best hash table based aligners.

In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient hashing approach by sparsely embedding a sample in the training sample space and encoding the sparse embedding vector over a learned dictionary. To this end, we partition the sample space into clusters via a linear spectral clustering method, and then represent each sample as a sparse vector of normalized probabilities that it falls into its several closest clusters. This actually embeds each sample sparsely in the sample space. The sparse embedding vector is employed as the feature of each sample for hashing. We then propose a least variance encoding model, which learns a dictionary to encode the sparse embedding feature, and consequently binarize the coding coefficients as the hash codes. The dictionary and the binarization threshold are jointly optimized in our model.

(2) Previous chemical shift prediction approaches either require homologous models with high sequence similarity or rely heavily on accurate backbone and side-chain structural coordinates. When neither sequence homologues nor structural coordinates are available, we must resort to other information to predict H(α) chemical shifts. Predicting accurate H(α) chemical shifts using other obtainable information, such as the chemical shifts of nearby backbone atoms (i.e., adjacent atoms in the sequence), can remedy the above dilemmas, and hence advance NMR-based structural studies of proteins. By specifically exploiting the dependencies on chemical shifts of nearby backbone atoms, we propose a novel machine learning algorithm, called HASH, to predict H(α) chemical shifts. HASH combines a new fragment-based chemical shift search approach with a non-parametric regression model, called the generalized additive model, to effectively solve the prediction problem.

This is largely due to the rapid nitrifying soil environment of present-day agricultural systems.;In this Viewpoint paper, the importance of regulating nitrification as a strategy to minimize N leakage and to improve N-use efficiency (NUE) in agricultural systems is highlighted. The ability to suppress soil nitrification by the release of nitrification inhibitors from plant roots is termed \'biological nitrification inhibition\' (BNI), an active plant-mediated natural function that can limit the amount of N cycling via the nitrification pathway. The development of a bioassay using luminescent Nitrosomonas to quantify nitrification inhibitory activity from roots has facilitated the characterization of BNI function. Release of BNIs from roots is a tightly regulated physiological process, with extensive genetic variability found in selected crops and pasture grasses. Here, the current status of understanding of the BNI function is reviewed using Brachiaria forage grasses, wheat and sorghum to illustrate how BNI function can be utilized for achieving low-nitrifying agricultural systems. A fundamental shift towards ammonium (NH4(+))-dominated agricultural systems could be achieved by using crops and pastures with high BNI capacities. When viewed from an agricultural and environmental perspective, the BNI function in plants could potentially have a large influence on biogeochemical cycling and closure of the N loop in crop-livestock systems.', 'AMO;BNI;BNI capacity;HAO;Nitrosomonas;ammonia mono-oxygenase;biological nitrification inhibition;brachialactone;fatty acids;high-nitrifying production systems;hydroxylamine oxidoreductase;low-nitrifying production systems;nitrate leaching;nitrification;nitrous oxide emissions;sustainability;synthetic nitrification inhibitors', 'Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences (JIRCAS), Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. subbarao@jircas.affrc.go.jp;', 'England', '10.1093/aob/mcs230', '', '', '', '', '1', '', NULL, '');

Even though annotation is one of the primary goals of a transcriptome assembly, the success of assembly strategies does not consider the impact of k-mer selection on the annotation output. This study provides an in-depth k-mer selection analysis that is focused on the degree of functional annotation achieved for a non-model organism where no reference genome information is available. Individual k-mers and clustered assemblies (CA) were considered using three representative software packages. Pair-wise comparison analyses (between individual k-mers and CAs) were produced to reveal missing Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) ortholog identifiers (KOIs), and to determine a strategy that maximizes the recovery of biological information in a de novo transcriptome assembly.;Analyses of single k-mer assemblies resulted in the generation of various quantities of contigs and functional annotations within the selection window of k-mers (k-19 to k-63). For each k-mer in this window, generated assemblies contained certain unique contigs and KOIs that were not present in the other k-mer assemblies. Producing a non-redundant CA of k-mers 19 to 63 resulted in a more complete functional annotation than any single k-mer assembly. However, a fraction of unique annotations remained (~0.19 to 0.27% of total KOIs) in the assemblies of individual k-mers (k-19 to k-63) that were not present in the non-redundant CA. A workflow to recover these unique annotations is presented.;This study demonstrated that different k-mer choices result in various quantities of unique contigs per single k-mer assembly which affects biological information that is retrievable from the transcriptome. This undesirable effect can be minimized, but not eliminated, with clustering of multi-k assemblies with redundancy removal.

Although plenty of methods on generating hash codes have been proposed in recent years, there are still two key points that needed to be improved: 1) how to precisely preserve the similarity structure of the original data and 2) how to obtain the hash codes of the previously unseen data. In this paper, we propose our spline regression hashing method, in which both the local and global data similarity structures are exploited. To better capture the local manifold structure, we introduce splines developed in Sobolev space to find the local data mapping function.

Here, we propose a novel genome-wide domain prediction method, SECOM. Instead of conducting all-against-all sequence alignment, SECOM first indexes all the proteins in the genome by using a hash seed function. Local similarity can thus be detected and encoded into a graph structure, in which each node represents a protein sequence and each edge weight represents the shared hash seeds between the two nodes. SECOM then formulates the domain prediction problem as an overlapping community-finding problem in this graph. A backward graph percolation algorithm that efficiently identifies the domains is proposed. We tested SECOM on five recently sequenced genomes of aquatic animals. Our tests demonstrated that SECOM was able to identify most of the known domains identified by InterProScan. When compared with the alignment-based method, SECOM showed higher sensitivity in detecting putative novel domains, while it was also three orders of magnitude faster.

The tools commonly used today are based on either a hash table or the suffix array/Burrow-Wheeler transform. These algorithms are the best suited to finding the genome position of exactly matching short reads. However, they have limited capacity to handle the mismatches. To find n-mismatches, they requires O(2n) times the computation time of exact matches. Therefore, acceleration techniques are required.;We propose a hash-based method for genome mapping that reduces the number of hash references for finding mismatches without increasing the size of the hash table. The method regards DNA subsequences as words on Galois extension field GF(2²) and each word is encoded to a code word of a perfect Hamming code. The perfect Hamming code defines equivalence classes of DNA subsequences. Each equivalence class includes subsequence whose corresponding words on GF(2²) are encoded to a corresponding code word. The code word is used as a hash key to store these subsequences in a hash table. Specifically, it reduces by about 70% the number of hash keys necessary for searching the genome positions of all 2-mismatches of 21-base-long DNA subsequence.;The paper shows perfect hamming code can reduce the number of hash references for hash-based genome mapping. As the computation time to calculate code words is far shorter than a hash reference, our method is effective to reduce the computation time to map short DNA sequences to genome.

The purple panicle was caused by a single dominant locus. Each of the three characters (purple lamina, purple stigma and purple seed) was governed by two complementary loci.

A dominant allele at this locus seems to be a prerequisite for the development of purple pigmentation in the lamina, stigma and seed.

While traditional applications of video hashing lie in database searches and content authentication, the emergence of websites such as YouTube and DailyMotion poses a challenging problem of anti-piracy video search. That is, hashes or fingerprints of an original video (provided to YouTube by the content owner) must be matched against those uploaded to YouTube by users to identify instances of \"illegal\" or undesirable uploads. Because the uploaded videos invariably differ from the original in their digital representation (owing to incidental or malicious distortions), robust video hashes are desired. We model videos as order-3 tensors and use multilinear subspace projections, such as a reduced rank parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to construct video hashes. We observe that, unlike most standard descriptors of video content, tensor-based subspace projections can offer excellent robustness while effectively capturing the spatio-temporal essence of the video for discriminability. We introduce randomization in the hash function by dividing the video into (secret key based) pseudo-randomly selected overlapping sub-cubes to prevent against intentional guessing and forgery. Detection theoretic analysis of the proposed hash-based video identification is presented, where we derive analytical approximations for error probabilities. Remarkably, these theoretic error estimates closely mimic empirically observed error probability for our hash algorithm.

Compared with classical side-information-independent (SII) noise modeling adopted in current DVC solutions, it is theoretically proven that side-information-dependent (SID) modeling improves the Wyner-Ziv coding performance.

Using different sets of the original data (data set 1: insurance certificate number, name, and sex; data set 2: insurance certificate number, date of birth, and relationship status), we compared the percentage of successful record matches obtained by using data set 1 to generate key codes with the percentage obtained when both data sets were used.;The dictionary\'s automatic conversion of disease names successfully standardized 98.1% of approximately 2 million new receipts entered into the database. The percentage of anonymous matches was higher for the combined data sets (98.0%) than for data set 1 (88.5%).;The use of standardized disease classifications and anonymous record linkage substantially contributed to the construction of a large, chronologically organized database of receipts.

Here, we report enrichment of the pearl millet molecular linkage map by exploiting low-cost and high-throughput Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers. Genomic representation from 95 diverse genotypes was used to develop a DArT array with circa 7,000 clones following PstI/BanII complexity reduction.

We propose an image hashing algorithm based on compressive sensing principles, which solves both the authentication and the tampering identification problems. The original content producer generates a hash using a small bit budget by quantizing a limited number of random projections of the authentic image.

In addition, if the introduced tampering is sparse in some orthonormal basis or redundant dictionary, an approximation is given in the pixel domain.

When a reference genome is available, mapping reads on it is the first step of this analysis. Read mapping programs owe their efficiency to the use of involved genome indexing data structures, like the Burrows-Wheeler transform. Recent solutions index both the genome, and the k-mers of the reads using hash-tables to further increase efficiency and accuracy. In various contexts (e.g. assembly or transcriptome analysis), read processing requires to determine the sub-collection of reads that are related to a given sequence, which is done by searching for some k-mers in the reads. Currently, many developments have focused on genome indexing structures for read mapping, but the question of read indexing remains broadly unexplored. However, the increase in sequence throughput urges for new algorithmic solutions to query large read collections efficiently.;Here, we present a solution, named Gk arrays, to index large collections of reads, an algorithm to build the structure, and procedures to query it. Once constructed, the index structure is kept in main memory and is repeatedly accessed to answer queries like \"given a k-mer, get the reads containing this k-mer (once/at least once)\". We compared our structure to other solutions that adapt uncompressed indexing structures designed for long texts and show that it processes queries fast, while requiring much less memory. Our structure can thus handle larger read collections. We provide examples where such queries are adapted to different types of read analysis (SNP detection, assembly, RNA-Seq).;Gk arrays constitute a versatile data structure that enables fast and more accurate read analysis in various contexts.

To find biclusters, a model called pCluster was proposed. A pCluster consists of a set of genes and a set of conditions, where the expression levels of these genes have a similar variation under these conditions. Based on this model, most of the previous methods need to compute MDSs (maximum dimension sets) for every two genes in the microarray data. Since the number of genes is far larger than the number of conditions, this step is inefficient. Another method called MicroCluster was proposed. This method does not compute MDSs for every two genes, and transforms the problem into a graph problem. However, it needs to solve the Maximal Clique problem, which is NP-Complete. To avoid the above disadvantages, in this paper, we propose a new method, CE-Tree (Condition-Enumeration Tree), for finding pClusters. Instead of generating MDSs for every two genes, we generate only MDSs for every two conditions. Then, based only on these MDSs, we expand the CE-Tree in a special local breadth-first within global depth-first manner to efficiently find all pClusters.

With the fast accumulation of graph databases, similarity search in graph databases has emerged as an important research topic. Graph similarity search has applications in a wide range of domains including cheminformatics, bioinformatics, sensor network management, social network management, and XML documents, among others.Most of the current graph indexing methods focus on subgraph query processing, i.e. determining the set of database graphs that contains the query graph and hence do not directly support similarity search. In data mining and machine learning, various graph kernel functions have been designed to capture the intrinsic similarity of graphs. Though successful in constructing accurate predictive and classification models for supervised learning, graph kernel functions have (i) high computational complexity and (ii) non-trivial difficulty to be indexed in a graph database.Our objective is to bridge graph kernel function and similarity search in graph databases by proposing (i) a novel kernel-based similarity measurement and (ii) an efficient indexing structure for graph data management. Our method of similarity measurement builds upon local features extracted from each node and their neighboring nodes in graphs. A hash table is utilized to support efficient storage and fast search of the extracted local features. Using the hash table, a graph kernel function is defined to capture the intrinsic similarity of graphs and for fast similarity query processing. We have implemented our method, which we have named G-hash, and have demonstrated its utility on large chemical graph databases. Our results show that the G-hash method achieves state-of-the-art performance for k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classification.

Therefore, we sought to develop additional SSR markers for the pearl millet research community.;A set of new pearl millet SSR markers were developed using available sequence information from 3520 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). After clustering, unigene sequences (2175 singlets and 317 contigs) were searched for the presence of SSRs. We detected 164 sequences containing SSRs (at least 14 bases in length), with a density of one per 1.75 kb of EST sequence.

Ninety primer pairs were designed and tested for their ability to detect polymorphism across a panel of 11 pairs of pearl millet mapping population parental lines. Clear amplification products were obtained for 58 primer pairs. Of these, 15 were monomorphic across the panel.

These traits were measured in tolerant/sensitive pearl millet genotypes, including near-isogenic lines introgressed with a terminal drought tolerance QTL (NIL-QTLs). Most genotypic differences were found under well-watered conditions. ABA levels under well-watered conditions were higher in tolerant genotypes, including NIL-QTLs, than in sensitive genotypes, and ABA did not increase under water stress. Well-watered Tr was lower in tolerant than in sensitive genotypes at all VPD levels. Except for one line, Tr slowed down in tolerant lines above a breakpoint at 1.40-1.90 kPa, with the slope decreasing >50%, whereas sensitive lines showed no change in that Tr response across the whole VPD range. It is concluded that two water-saving (avoidance) mechanisms may operate under well-watered conditions in tolerant pearl millet: (i) a low Tr even at low VPD conditions, which may relate to leaf ABA; and (ii) a sensitivity to higher VPD that further restricts Tr, which suggests the involvement of hydraulic signals. Both traits, which did not lead to TE differences, could contribute to absolute water saving seen in part due to dry weight increase differences.

In this sense, our approach contains three steps: 1) the search process to discover visually and semantically similar search results, 2) the mining process to identify salient terms from textual descriptions of the search results, and 3) the annotation rejection process to filter out noisy terms yielded by Step 2. To ensure real-time annotation, two key techniques are leveraged-one is to map the high-dimensional image visual features into hash codes, the other is to implement it as a distributed system, of which the search and mining processes are provided as Web services. As a typical result, the entire process finishes in less than 1 second. Since no training data set is required, our approach enables annotating with unlimited vocabulary and is highly scalable and robust to outliers. Experimental results on both real Web images and a benchmark image data set show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

Consistently, silencing of Hes-6 by siRNA resulted in downregulation of E2F-1 expression, whereas estrogen treatment caused induction of Hes-6 and downstream targets hASH-1 and E2F-1 in MCF-7 cells.;Together, the data suggest that Hes-6 is a potential oncogene overexpressed in breast cancer, with a tumor-promoting and proliferative function. Furthermore, Hes-6 is a novel estrogen-regulated gene in breast cancer cells.

This has two serious effects on the performance of the method. First, it can result in an inefficient storage of data which can increase recognition time. Second, given that geometric hashing is highly amenable to parallel implementation, a nonuniform distribution of data poses difficulties in tackling the load-balancing problem. Finding a \"good\" geometric hash function which redistributes the invariants uniformly over the hash space is not easy. Current approaches make assumptions about the statistical characteristics of the data and then use techniques from probability theory to calculate a transformation that maps the nonuniform distribution of invariants to a uniform one. In this paper, a new approach is proposed based on an elastic hash table. In contrast to existing approaches which try to redistribute the invariants over the hash bins, we proceed oppositely by distributing the hash bins over the invariants. The key idea is to associate the hash bins with the output nodes of a self-organizing feature map (SOFM) neural network which is trained using the invariants as training examples. In this way, the location of a hash bin in the space of invariants is determined by the weight vector of the node associated with the hash bin. During training, the SOFM spreads the hash bins proportionally to the distribution of invariants (i.e., more hash bins are assigned to higher density areas while less hash bins are assigned to lower density areas) and adjusts their size so that they eventually hold almost the same number of invariants. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it is a process that adapts to the invariants through learning. Hence, it makes absolutely no assumptions about the statistical characteristics of the invariants and the geometric hash function is actually computed through learning. Furthermore, SOFM\'s \"topology preserving\" property ensures that the computed geometric hash function should be well behaved. The proposed approach, was shown to perform well on both artificial and real data.', '', 'Department of Computer Science, University of Nevada, Reno, NV 89557, USA.;', 'United States', '10.1109/72.668897', '', '', '', '', '1', '', NULL, '');

To investigate this possibility the AT domains from modules 2 and 3 of the epothilone PKS were examined in the heterologous DEBS1-TE model PKS. Substitution of AT1 of DEBS1-TE by epoAT2 and epoAT3 both resulted in functional PKSs, although lower yields of total products were observed when compared to DEBS1-TE (2% and 11.5% respectively).

This study has been performed using the NE prostate cancer mouse model (12T-10) and the derivative allograft model (NE-10).;Immunohistochemical studies have shown that the neuroendocrine prostate tumors express the transcription factors Foxa2, mouse achaete-scute homolog-1 (mash-1), neurogenin3 (Ngn3) and Nkx2.2. These tumors show a loss of hairy/enhancer of split (Hes-1), a gene that inhibits NE differentiation. Human NE prostate cancers also express Foxa2 and human achaete-scute homolog-1 (HASH-1). These genes are expressed in NE prostate tumors in the similar sequential manner as they appear in a pancreatic beta-cell endocrine differentiation. Foxa2 expression is detected in early prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Mash-1 expression is detected in a few clusters within low grade PIN lesions and Nkx2.2 expression is rarely detected in individual scattered cells within the PIN lesion. Ngn3 and Nkx2.2 frequently appear in the invasive NE cancer. Subsequent NE metastasis to lung and liver show a distinct gene expression pattern. The lung metastasis expresses Ngn3 but does not express Nkx2.2 whereas liver metastases do not express Ngn3 but express Nkx2.2.;These results suggest that Ngn3 and Nkx2.2 expression are markers for site-specific metastasis and/or transcriptionally regulated genes that are required for organ-specific metastasis.

Database searches have not been able to keep with this data explosion. Thus, speeding up the data searches becomes increasingly important in mass-spectrometry-based applications. Traditional database search methods use one-against-all comparisons of a query spectrum against a very large number of peptides generated from in silico digestion of protein sequences in a database, to filter potential candidates from this database followed by a detailed scoring and ranking of those filtered candidates.;In this article, we show that we can avoid the one-against-all comparisons. The basic idea is to design a set of hash functions to pre-process peptides in the database such that for each query spectrum we can use the hash functions to find only a small subset of peptide sequences that are most likely to match the spectrum. The construction of each hash function is based on a random spectrum and the hash value of a peptide is the normalized shared peak counts score (cosine) between the random spectrum and the hypothetical spectrum of the peptide. To implement this idea, we first embed each peptide into a unit vector in a high-dimensional metric space. The random spectrum is represented by a random vector, and we use random vectors to construct a set of hash functions called locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for preprocessing. We demonstrate that our mapping is accurate. We show that our method can filter out >95.65% of the spectra without missing any correct sequences, or gain 111 times speedup by filtering out 99.64% of spectra while missing at most 0.19% (2 out of 1014) of the correct sequences.

This approach is based on mutual information, probabilistic measures, hidden Markov models, and other purely statistical inputs. This approach also provides a uniquely common ground for comparative prokaryotic genomics. The approach is an on-going effort by its nature, as a multi-pass learning process, where each round is more informed than the last, and thereby allows a shift to the more powerful methods available for supervised learning at each iteration. It is envisaged that this \"bootstrap\" learning process will also be useful as a knowledge discovery tool. For such an ab initio prokaryotic gene-finder to work, however, it needs a mechanism to identify critical motif structure, such as those around the start of coding or start of transcription (and then, hopefully more).For eukaryotes, even with better start-of-coding identification, parsing of eukaryotic coding regions by the HMM is still limited by the HMM\'s single gene assumption, as evidenced by the poor performance in alternatively spliced regions. To address these complications an approach is described to expand the states in a eukaryotic gene-predictor HMM, to operate with two layers of DNA parsing. This extension from the single layer gene prediction parse is indicated after preliminary analysis of the C. elegans alt-splice statistics. State profiles have made use of a novel hash-interpolating MM (hIMM) method.

The invariancy of the shape signatures allows us to improve similarity searching efficiency by adopting a hierarchical coarse-to-fine strategy. We index the shape signatures using an efficient hashing-based technique. With the help of this technique we screen out unlikely candidates and perform detailed pairwise alignments only for a small number of candidates that survive the screening process. Contrary to other hashing based techniques, our technique employs domain specific information (not just geometric information) in constructing the hash key, and hence, is more tuned to the domain of biology. Furthermore, the invariancy, localization, and compactness of the shape signatures allow us to utilize a well-known local sequence alignment algorithm for aligning two protein structures.

A major difference is that a PAF is constructed on the fly as the registration proceeds; it does not require any precomputation time, nor does it make any prior assumptions of the patient pose or limit the permissible range of patient motion. A PAF effectively acts as a cache memory for projection values once they are computed, rather than as a lookup table for precomputed projections like standard AFs. We use a cylindrical attenuation field parametrization, which is better suited for many medical applications of 2D-3D registration than the usual two-plane parametrization. The computed attenuation values are stored in a hash table for time-efficient storage and access.

Data analysis identified several differentially regulated genes between normal brain tissue and astrocytoma as well as between grades II/III astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; grade IV).

There are three main forms of cannabis: marijuana, hash and hash oil, all of which contain the main psychoactive constituent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Cannabis is most commonly smoked, however it can be added to foods. THC from cannabis enters the bloodstream and exerts its effects on the body via interaction with endogenous receptors. Cannabis affects almost every system of the body, particularly the cardiovascular, respiratory and immune systems. It also has acute and chronic effects on the mental health of some users. Therefore, chronic abuse is a concern because of its negative effects on general physical and mental health. Cannabis abusers generally have poorer oral health than non-users, with an increased risk of dental caries and periodontal diseases. Cannabis smoke acts as a carcinogen and is associated with dysplastic changes and pre-malignant lesions within the oral mucosa. Users are also prone to oral infections, possibly due to the immunosuppressive effects. Dental treatment on patients intoxicated on cannabis can result in the patient experiencing acute anxiety, dysphoria and psychotic-like paranoiac thoughts.

We segment two scans, prone and supine, independently and with the goal of improved colon coverage. Both segmentations would be available for subsequent polyp detection systems. Segmenting and analyzing both scans improves surface coverage by at least 6% over supine or prone alone. According to subjective evaluation, the average coverage is about 87.5% of the entire colon. Employing near-air threshold and elongation criteria, only 6% of the data sets include extracolonic components (EC) in the segmentation. The observed surface shape accuracy of the segmentation is adequate for significant-size (6 mm) polyp detection, which is also verified by the results of the prototype detection algorithm. The segmentation takes less than 5 minutes on an AMD 1-GHz single-processor PC, which includes reading the volume data and writing the surface results. The surface-based segmentation algorithm is practical for subsequent polyp detection algorithms in that it produces high coverage, has a low EC rate, maintains local shape accuracy, and has a computational efficiency that makes real-time polyp detection possible. A fully automatic or computer-aided polyp detection system using this technique is likely to benefit future colon cancer early screening.', '', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Medical Center Blvd., Winston-Salem, NC 27157-1022, USA. hongli@wfubmc.edu;', 'United States', '10.1007/s10278-004-1032-4', '', '', '', '', '1', '', NULL, '');

In particular, the HASH-1-PHOX2A-PHOX2B developmental cascade was proposed as a candidate pathway because it controls the development of neurons with a definitive or transient noradrenergic phenotype, upstream from the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and tyrosine hydroxylase. We recently showed that PHOX2B is the major CCHS locus, whose mutation accounts for 60% of cases. We also studied the proneural HASH-1 gene and identified a heterozygous nucleotide substitution in three CCHS patients. To analyze the functional consequences of HASH-1 mutations, we developed an in vitro model of noradrenergic differentiation in neuronal progenitors derived from the mouse vagal neural crest, reproducing in vitro the HASH-PHOX-RET pathway. All HASH-1 mutant alleles impaired noradrenergic neuronal development, when overexpressed from adenoviral constructs. Thus, HASH-1 mutations may contribute to the CCHS phenotype in rare cases, consistent with the view that the abnormal chemical control of breathing observed in CCHS patients is due to the impairment of noradrenergic neurons during early steps of brainstem development.', '', 'Unité de Recherches sur les Handicaps Génétiques de l\'Enfant INSERM U-393, and Département de Génétique, Hôpital Necker-Enfants Malades, Paris, France.;', 'England', '10.1093/hmg/ddg339', '', '', '', '', '1', '', NULL, '');

This paper presents a new formulation based on the generalized inverse plant control for the color error reduction process. In our formulation, the printer input and scanner output correspond to the input and output of a system plant, respectively. Obviously, if the printer input equals the scanner output, then there are no color errors involved in the entire system. In other words, the plant becomes an identity system. To achieve this goal, a plant generalized inverse should be identified and added to the original system. Since the system of a combination of both scanner and printer is highly nonlinear, CMAC-based neural networks, which have the capability to learn arbitrary nonlinearity, are applied to identify the plant generalized inverse. CMAC network is a perceptron-like feedforward structure with associative memory properties. Its memory requirements can be greatly reduced by the use of hash coding techniques. In order for CMAC networks to construct high-order, smooth, nonlinear plant inverse, more general CMAC addressing schemes have been proposed in conjunction with use of B-spline receptive functions. It is shown that B-spline CMAC networks learn orders of magnitude more rapidly than typical implementations of back propagation in the multilayered neural networks, due to the local nature of its weighting updating and the finite support of B-spline receptive field functions. Finally, a number of test samples are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.', '', 'Dept. of Communication Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsin-Chu, Taiwan.;', 'Singapore', '', '', '', '', '', '1', '', NULL, '');

The binding of human achaete-scute homologue 2 (Hash-2) to the E-box cluster was shown by gel mobility-shift assay. The overexpression of Hash-2 caused a marked decrease in PACE4 gene expression. When BeWo cells were grown under low oxygen (2%) conditions, the expression of Hash-2 decreased, while that of PACE4 increased.

The partitioning of variance components based on the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) for diversity analysis revealed high within-accession variability (30.9%), but the variability between accessions was significantly higher (69.1%) than that within the accessions. A dendrogram based on the dissimilarity matrix obtained using Ward\'s algorithm further delineated the 250 plants into ten major clusters, each comprised of plants from a single accession (with the exception of two single plants). A similar result was found in an earlier study using morpho-agronomic traits and geographic origin. This study demonstrated the utility of RFLP markers in detecting polymorphism and estimating genetic diversity in a highly cross-pollinated species such as pearl millet.

We present a method, authenticity and integrity of digital mammography, here which can meet the requirements of authenticity and integrity for mammography image (IM) transmission. The authenticity and integrity for mammography (AIDM) consists of the following four modules. 1) Image preprocessing: To segment breast pixels from background and extract patient information from digital imaging and communication in medicine (DICOM) image header. 2) Image hashing: To compute an image hash value of the mammogram using the MD5 hash algorithm. 3) Data encryption: To produce a digital envelope containing the encrypted image hash value (digital signature) and corresponding patient information. 4) Data embedding: To embed the digital envelope into the image. This is done by replacing the least significant bit of a random pixel of the mammogram by one bit of the digital envelope bit stream and repeating for all bits in the bit stream. Experiments with digital IMs demonstrate the following. 1) In the expert center, only the user who knows the private key can open the digital envelope and read the patient information data and the digital signature of the mammogram transmitted from the examination site. 2) Data integrity can be verified by matching the image hash value decrypted from the digital signature with that computed from the transmitted image. 3) No visual quality degradation is detected in the embedded image compared with the original.

Recently it was hypothesized that spice use yields a health benefit: cleansing food of parasites and pathogens before it is eaten, thereby reducing food poisoning and foodborne illnesses. In support, most spices have antimicrobial properties and use of spices in meat-based recipes is greatest in hot climates, where the diversity and growth rates of microorganisms are highest. A critical prediction of the antimicrobial hypothesis is that spices should be used less in preparing vegetables than meat dishes. This is because cells of dead plants are better protected physically and chemically against bacteria and fungi than cells of dead animals (whose immune system ceased functioning at death), so fewer spices would be necessary to make vegetables safe for consumption. We tested this corollary by compiling information on 2129 vegetable-only recipes from 107 traditional cookbooks of 36 countries. Analyses revealed that spice use increased with increasing ambient temperature, but less dramatically than in meat-based recipes. In all 36 countries, vegetable dishes called for fewer spices per recipe than meat dishes; 27 of these differences were significant. Of 41 individual spices, 38 were used less frequently in vegetable recipes; 30 of these differences were significant. Proportions of recipes that called for >1 spice and >1 extremely potent antimicrobial spice also were significantly lower for vegetable dishes. By every measure, vegetable-based recipes were significantly less spicy than meat-based recipes. Within-country analyses control for possible differences in spice plant availability and degrees of cultural independence.

To speed up the process of finding suitable therapy recommendations, we have applied case-based reasoning (CBR) techniques.

Formation of these structures, which we term \"hash-marks\" for their characteristic appearance in association with DNA, requires the presence of the T4 polymerase accessory proteins (the products of T4 genes 44, 45 and 62), ATP and appropriate DNA cofactors. ATP hydrolysis by the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity of the accessory proteins is required for visualization of the hash-mark structures. If ATP hydrolysis is stopped by chelation of Mg2+, by dilution with a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, or by exhaustion of the ATP supply, the DNA-associated structures disappear within seconds to minutes, indicating that they have a finite and relatively short lifetime. The labile nature of the structures makes their study by more conventional methods of electron microscopy, as well as by most other structural approaches, difficult if not impossible. Addition of T4 gene 32 protein increases the number of hash-mark structures, as well as increasing the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Using plasmid DNA in either a native (supercoiled) or enzymatically modified state, we have shown that nicked or gapped DNA is required as a cofactor for hash-mark formation. Stimulation of the ATPase activity of the accessory proteins has a similar cofactor requirement. These conditions for the formation and visualization of the structures parallel those required for the action of these complexes in promoting the enzymatic activity of the T4 DNA polymerase, as well as the transcription of late T4 genes. Substructure in the hash-marks has been examined by image analysis, which reveals a variation in the projected density of the subunits comprising the structures. The three-dimensional size of the hash-marks, modeled as a solid ellipsoid, is consistent with that of the gene 44/62 protein subcomplex. Density variations suggest an arrangement of subunits, either tetragonal or trigonal, viewed from a variety of angles about the DNA axis. The hash-mark structures often appear in clusters, even in DNA that has a single nick. We interpret this distribution as the result of one-dimensional translocation of the hash-marks along the DNA after their ATP-dependent initial association with, and injection into, the DNA at nicks or gaps.', '', 'Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon, Eugene 97403.;', 'United States;United States;United States;England', '', '', '', '', '', '1', '', NULL, '');

Controls suggest that the activity reported comes from the brain; it is reversibly flattened by doses of urethane that do not embarrass respiration. Muscle potentials are only troublesome on occasion. Seen through a wideband filter, neuronal spikes are usually small or below noise level under these conditions; slow waves (1-70 Hz) dominate, with a maximum less than 25 Hz, usually less than 10 Hz and no consistent sharp peaks. The fall in power above ca. 25 Hz is usually slower than in the typical vertebrate EEG but the average power spectrum is much more like those of vertebrate brains than of cerebral ganglia of other invertebrates (insect, crustacean, gastropod). Variance among sample epochs is large, e.g. short spells may have relatively much more low frequency (less than 25 Hz) or more \'hashy\' high frequency (greater than 50 Hz) energy; there may be runs of spikes. Fluctuation in the composition of ongoing activity is graphically shown by writing out in parallel the outputs of several narrow band (one octave) filters; this shows irregular low frequency waxing and waning of the amplitude in each band. The envelopes were computed and their peak power is around 1 Hz or lower; the waxing and waning in the several bands is sometimes strongly correlated, especially when the envelope amplitude is large and slow. Optic lobe activity tends usually to be faster, with more small spikey hash than in the vertical lobe. The described electrical activity of the brain is strikingly episodic; it is recorded during seconds or minutes separated by long intervals of nearly electrical silence (10-40 dB lower power; the difference larger at frequencies greater than 20 Hz).

A large proportion of the proviruses in the target cells had E and one copy of the direct repeat deleted. Direct repeats of 1,333 and 788 bp were deleted at frequencies of 93 and 85%, respectively. To achieve a 100% deletion efficiency in target cells after ex vivo infection and drug selection, we constructed a self-activating vector that simultaneously deleted E and reconstituted the neomycin phosphotransferase gene. Selection of the target cells for resistance to G418 (a neomycin analog) ensured that all integrated proviruses had E deleted. The proviruses with E deleted were mobilized by a replication-competent virus 267,000-fold less efficiently than proviruses with E. We named these self-inactivating vectors E- (E-minus) vectors. These vectors should increase the safety of retroviral vector-mediated gene therapy by preventing the spread of vector sequences to nontarget cells in the event of coinfection with helper virus. We propose that direct-repeat deletions occur during RNA-dependent DNA synthesis and suggest that template switches occur without a requirement for RNA breaks. The minimum template dissociation frequency was estimated as 8%/100 bp per replication cycle. These vectors demonstrate that large direct repeats and template-switching properties of reverse transcriptase can be utilized to delete any sequence or reconstitute genes during retroviral replication.', '', 'Department of Biochemistry, West Virginia University, Morgantown 26506, USA.;', 'United States;United States', '', '', '', '', '', '1', '', NULL, '');

Averaged evoked potentials (AEP) in response to pulses and sine waves of electric current, either as a homogeneous field or a large dipole field around the fish, have been recorded from the brain in 5 genera of elasmobranchs and 10 genera of siluriform fishes. 2. In the elasmobranchs, AEP\'s and spike-hash bursts are described from medulla, cerebellum, mesencephalon and telencephalon. A complex  sequence of early and late waves is found in each level. Two sets of factors influence the latency and amplitude of the component waves. One is stimulus parameters including intensity, stimulus orientation, sign of the change of current, position of dipole, serial number in the first few cycles of a train as well as interval or frequency of a regular series. Separate component peaks of the complex AEP appear to have different dependencies upon these factors. To sinusoidal stimuli the best response by a certain criterion is at 20--30 Hz in a shark (Carcharhinus), 10--15 Hz in a ray (Potamotrygon); these are much higher than the values based on behavior from previous authors. The lowest threshold, with moderate averaging, was 0.015 muV/cm (= 0.8 nA/cm2) in marine species, less than 50 muV/cm (= 0.7 nA/cm2) in the freshwater ray. 3. The other set of factors determining AEP is brain parameters, including the recording locus, the type of electrode and electrode advance and the state of the brain (anesthesia, etc.). There is evidence of topographic segregation of some stimulus parameters, but mapping was not undertaken. Responsive regions are described in the several brain levels. 4. The best loci for electric AEP are distinct from those for acoustic and photic AEPs. No interaction between these was found. 5. All of the siluriforms tested show electroreception by the criterion of high sensitivity AEP. No obvious specialization was noted among the diverse species, but most were represented by a single experiment. Taken together with the previously known species, the sample of nine families of this large order suggests that this is a general characteristic of the order. 6. The best responses were found in the region of the torus semicircularis and in the lateral lobe. The lowest threshold by the criterion used was less than 0.15 mV/cm (= 2 nA/cm2), but some were nearly 2 mV/cm. Compared to much lower values in Ictalurus, this suggests species differences although part of the difference may be due to failure to record from the optimal locus.

As in our hands the chemical colorimetric method has proved more accurate, these values rather than the physiological values will be given in the final analysis. The two adrenal glands in the same individual as a rule contain about the same amount of adrenalin per gram, but variations of 10 to 20 per cent. are not unusual. Normal dogs show an index which may vary from 1.2 to 1.8 milligrams. The dogs were killed by short ether anesthesia and bleeding from the carotid. Normal human beings, dying from trauma, rupture of aneurysm, etc., show an index of 0.35 to 0.50 of a milligram, when autopsy takes place a few hours after death. Deterioration of uncut glands or of a gland hash kept on ice in the dark is not rapid and rarely exceeds 10 per cent. in twenty-four hours. Acute intoxication in dogs shows a low adrenalin index, especially the intoxication associated with intestinal obstruction and the closed intestinal loop. Intravenous injection of the poison found in closed duodenal loops sufficient to cause fatal shock causes a great drop in the adrenalin index, at times to one fourth normal or even lower. After recovery from a sublethal toxic dose the adrenalin index may rise rapidly to a point considerably above normal. The same may hold for recovery after chloroform poisoning. Anesthesia by chloroform or ether causes a drop in the adrenalin index depending upon the length of anesthesia and probably in part on the depth of anesthesia. Liver poisons (chloroform, phosphorus, hydrazine) cause a drop in the adrenal index to a low level, perhaps one half normal in acute cases. Pancreas extirpation with prolonged glycosuria and death produces a great drop in the adrenalin index (cat). There is evidence that this may hold in some cases of human diabetes. In man disease of one adrenal (tuberculosis) may be associated with an adrenalin index of double the normal value in the intact adrenal. Pernicious anemia is the only disease so far found to present an abnormally high adrenalin index, and the single case shows an index at least twice normal. This is of interest especially in relation to the views recently put forward to indicate that the spleen and adrenal may be concerned in the lipoid metabolism which is thought to be profoundly disturbed in this disease. Secondary anemia due to repeated hemorrhage or the intoxication of cancer or tuberculosis causes a fall in the adrenalin index. Cachexia due to neoplasm or tuberculosis may cause a marked fall in the adrenalin index, perhaps to less than one half of normal. Acute infections (typhoid fever), septicemia, peritonitis, and similar conditions may be associated with a normal adrenalin index or one somewhat below normal. Diseases of the kidneys, heart, or blood vessels associated with elevated blood pressure show no constant variation in the adrenalin index, which may be normal or slightly subnormal.', '', 'Hunterian Laboratory of Experimental Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical School, Baltimore.;', 'United States', '10.1084/jem.19.6.536', '', '', '', '', '1', '', NULL, '');

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of TFs on experimental periodontitis in rats.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty rats were divided into five groups: Control (glycerol application without ligation), Ligature (glycerol application with ligation), TF1 (1 mg/mL TF application with ligation), TF10 (10 mg/mL TF application with ligation), and TF100 (100 mg/mL TF application with ligation). To induce experimental periodontitis, ligatures were placed around maxillary first molars bilaterally. After ligature placement, 100 μL glycerol or TFs were topically applied to the rats daily, and rats were euthanized 7 days after ligature placement. Micro-computed tomography was used to measure bone resorption in the left side of the maxilla, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the expression of interleukin (IL)-6, growth-regulated gene product/cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (Gro/Cinc-1, rat equivalent of IL-8), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (Mmp-9), receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa Β ligand (Rankl), osteoprotegerin (Opg), and the Rankl/Opg ratio in gingival tissue. With tissue from the right side of the maxilla, hematoxylin and eosin staining was used for histological analysis, immunohistochemical staining for leukocyte common antigen (CD45) was used to assess inflammation, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining was used to observe the number of osteoclasts.RESULTS: The TF10 and TF100 groups, but not the TF1 group, had significant inhibition of alveolar bone loss, reduction in inflammatory cell infiltration in the periodontium, and significantly reduced numbers of CD45-positive cells and TRAP-positive osteoclasts compared with the Ligature group. Correspondingly, the TF10 and TF100 groups had significantly downregulated gene expression of IL-6, Gro/Cinc-1(IL-8), Mmp-9, and Rankl, but not of Opg. Consequently, Rankl/Opg expression was significantly increased in the Ligation group but was attenuated in the TF10 and TF100 groups.CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that topical application of TFs may reduce inflammation and bone resorption in experimental periodontitis. Therefore, TFs have therapeutic potential in the treatment of periodontal disease.© 2018 The Authors.

Cross-sectional and retrospective evidence indicates that tea consumption may be a promising approach in mitigating bone loss and in reducing risk of osteoporotic fractures among older adults.

Animal studies reveal that intake of tea polyphenols have pronounced positive effects on bone as shown by higher bone mass and trabecular bone volume, number, and thickness and lower trabecular separation via increasing bone formation and inhibition of bone resorption, resulting in greater bone strength. These osteoprotective effects appear to be mediated through antioxidant or antiinflammatory pathways along with their downstream signaling mechanisms. A short-term clinical trial of green tea polyphenols has translated the findings from ovariectomized animals to postmenopausal osteopenic women through evaluation of bioavailability, safety, bone turnover markers, muscle strength, and quality of life. For future studies, preclinical animal studies to optimize the dose of tea polyphenols for maximum osteoprotective efficacy and a follow-up short-term dose-response trial in postmenopausal osteopenic women are necessary to inform the design of randomized controlled studies in at-risk populations.

Efficacy was evaluated by examining changes in bone microarchitecture using histomorphometric and microcomputed tomographic analyses and by bone strength using the three-point bending test. A possible mechanism was studied by assessing the difference in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) expression in tibia using immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: LPS lowered trabecular volume fraction, thickness, and bone formation in proximal tibia while increasing osteoclast number and surface perimeter in proximal tibia and eroded surface in endocortical tibial shafts. GTP increased trabecular volume fraction and number in both femur and tibia and periosteal bone formation rate in tibial shafts while decreasing trabecular separation in proximal tibia and eroded surface in endocortical tibial shafts. There was an interaction between LPS and GTP in trabecular number, separation, bone formation, and osteoclast number in proximal tibia, and trabecular thickness and number in femur.

Some studies suggest that tea intake may protect against bone loss.OBJECTIVE: Using both cross-sectional and longitudinal study designs, we examined the relation of tea consumption with hip structure.DESIGN: Randomly selected women (n = 1500) aged 70-85 y participated in a 5-y prospective trial to evaluate whether oral calcium supplements prevent osteoporotic fractures. aBMD at the hip was measured at years 1 and 5 with DXA. A cross-sectional analysis of 1027 of these women at 5 y assessed the relation of usual tea intake, measured by using a questionnaire, with aBMD. A prospective analysis of 164 women assessed the relation of tea intake at baseline, measured by using a 24-h dietary recall, with change in aBMD from years 1 to 5.RESULTS: In the cross-sectional analysis, total hip aBMD was 2.8% greater in tea drinkers (x: 806; 95% CI: 797, 815 mg/cm(2)) than in non-tea drinkers (784; 764, 803 mg/cm(2)) (P &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.05). In the prospective analysis over 4 y, tea drinkers lost an average of 1.6% of their total hip aBMD (-32; -45, -19 mg/cm(2)), but non-tea drinkers lost 4.0% (-13; -20, -5 mg/cm(2)) (P &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.05).

Skew can be addressed by more fine-grained partitioning, at the cost of input duplication. For random load assignment, e.g., using a hash function, fine-grained partitioning creates a tradeoff between load expectation and variance. We show that minimizing load variance subject to a constraint on expectation is a monotone submodular maximization problem with Knapsack constraints, hence admitting provably near-optimal greedy solutions. In contrast to previous work on formal optimality guarantees, we can prove this result also for self-joins and more general load functions defined as weighted sum of input and output. We further demonstrate through experiments that this theoretical result leads to an effective algorithm for the problem of minimizing running time, even when load is assigned deterministically.\",\"tabstract\":\"\",\"status\":\"2\",\"pre_status\":\"2\"}', '保存数据', 1, '0.0.0.0', 1557887548, 1557887548);

Three isotopologues, H(2)AsO, HDAsO, and D(2)AsO have been detected as products of an electric discharge in mixtures of arsine or deuterated arsines, CO(2), and argon. The observed spectra are assigned as due to the B (2)A(\')-X (2)A(\') electronic transition in which an electron in the ground state pi orbital is promoted to the pi( *) orbital. Rotational analysis of high-resolution spectra proves that the radical is nonplanar in both electronic states with the following r(0) structures: r(&quot;)(As-H)=1.513(4) A, r(&quot;)(As-O)=1.672(1) A, theta(&quot;)(HAsH)=101.8(4) degrees , ground state out-of-plane angle=63.1 degrees ; r(\')(As-H)=1.525(10) A, r(\')(As-O)=1.806(3) A, theta(\')(HAsH)=93.4(10) degrees , and excited state out-of-plane angle=70.7 degrees . Small hyperfine splittings in the spectra have enabled the determination of the arsenic Fermi contact parameter in both states. The results of our ab initio studies of the ground and excited state of this radical (see immediately preceding paper) are in good agreement with the spectroscopic analysis.\",\"tabstract\":\"\",\"status\":\"3\",\"pre_status\":\"2\"}', '保存数据', 1, '0.0.0.0', 1557887557, 1557887557);
